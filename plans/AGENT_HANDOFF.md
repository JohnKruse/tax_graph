# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

The single living doc for active Claude (Architect) <-> Codex (Worker) coordination. Update it in
place; do NOT spawn new per-topic note files. Standing rules: `../AGENTS.md`. Master plan:
`../docs/engineering-plan.md`. Phase plan: `PHASE_M20.md`.

## How to use
- **Worker:** raise questions/blocks under **Open for Architect**.
- **Architect:** answer there (and pin durable decisions into the relevant `PHASE_<id>.md`), then
  clear the item. Record active direction under **From Architect**.
- **THIS FILE IS LIVE STATE ONLY.** The ball, the round in flight, the open questions, and the
  ONE task spec being worked. Durable rulings and standing constraints live in `../AGENTS.md`
  and are never pruned. History lives in git. **Queued future rounds are ONE LINE each** - a
  full spec written rounds ahead goes stale, which is exactly what happened to S57.
- **Keep it short.** A round that completes gets its narration DELETED, not appended - the
  accepted hash is the record and `git show <hash>` recovers everything. Only the current round,
  the standing constraints, and the binding rulings live here.
- **Prune at every acceptance, not "at phase close".** Pruned 2026-07-23 to 1,198 lines, then
  grew to 7,520 by 2026-08-02 because acceptance never triggered a prune. That is the failure
  mode this section exists to prevent.

## BALL

**BALL: CODEX - S97 IS CLOSE. The registry is gone and discovery works, but it mints a PHANTOM
DOCUMENT. Two fixes and the test migration is authorized below.**

**S97 VERIFIED BY ARCHITECT (`75babea`, 2026-08-11), running the CLI on the real corpus.** All five
target-state deletions are real: no `SOURCE_VERIFIED_WORKSHEET_TARGETS`, no `WorksheetTarget
.end_line` (the six remaining `end_line` hits are `InstructionLocator`'s unrelated field), no
`_contains_terminal_destination`, the CLI is document-scoped, and the boundary now BREAKS once rows
have started instead of stepping over it. **Schedule D returns 5 tables, all classified worksheet,
including Capital Loss Carryover found without being named. Schedule B returns 0 without erroring.**
Extents: 28% Rate Gain **7**, Unrecaptured 1250 **18**, Schedule D Tax **47**, Capital Loss
Carryover **13**.

**DEFECT 1 - THE PHANTOM, and it must be fixed before this goes near promotion.** Discovery emits
**five** draft documents, and `schedule_d_tax_worksheet_continued_2025` is not a worksheet. Measured:
its 17 lines are `31`-`47`, and **all 17 are already in `schedule_d_tax_worksheet_2025`'s 47** - a
100% overlap that would mint 17 duplicate addresses for the same printed lines. **"Continued" is a
page-break header, not a title.** Identity is the worksheet title with the continuation marker
stripped; **two tables resolving to one title are ONE document.** The merge already works - the base
correctly reaches 47 - so the fix is to stop emitting the table that was already absorbed.

**DEFECT 2 - THE HEADING-TO-LINE ASSOCIATION IS EMPTY.** All five tables report `lines=(none)` while
their own headings print it: `Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet-Lines 6 and 14`, `28% Rate Gain
Worksheet-Line 18`, `Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet-Line 19`. **The spec names this as
HTML structural authority, so it is deterministic and must not wait on the classifier** - the
model's job is worksheet-vs-lookup-vs-layout, not reading a line number that is printed in front
of it.

**NOT A DEFECT, and no rework needed:** the unrun provider classification leg. That is the
Architect's to run and the Worker was right to leave it.

**S95 ACCEPTED** (`64d112b`) - a `column` token rides beside `line` through the prompt, validator,
graph projection, external inputs, and stubs, and every id goes through the single
`_canonical_line_node_id` accessor. Clean slice, no second builder.

**S96 SPLIT** (`c9ee783`). **KEPT:** rendered-text harvesting, run-together heading titles, page
and continuation boundaries. **REJECTED:** `SOURCE_VERIFIED_WORKSHEET_TARGETS`, six worksheets with
hardcoded `end_line` and `expected_line_count`. **It is a table of answers where the pipeline
belongs** - a seventh worksheet needs a Python edit, which is the self-serve rule and the prime
directive both. Its docstring calls `end_line` a model decision; **no model is called anywhere on
that path**, there is no CLI flag and no config field.

**CODEX'S DEVIATION IS CORRECT AND THE ARCHITECT'S QUEUE WAS WRONG.** The 28% Rate Gain Worksheet
has **7** lines, not the 15 the queue claimed; verified at `instructions_schedule_d_2025.txt:718`.
Following the source over the spec and flagging it is exactly right.

**THE ARCHITECT'S CUE WAS ALSO WRONG, and that is why S96 took the shape it did.** "A worksheet's
last step names where its answer goes" fails on the Social Security Benefits Worksheet, where the
cue sits on **line 1** as well as line 18, so a first-match rule ends the worksheet after one line.
The pilot that proved the model could do this (`scratchpad/wsend.py`) no longer exists, so Codex
had the answers without the mechanism.

**MEASURED 2026-08-11 - THE STRUCTURE ALONE GETS ALL SIX**, no table, no cue, no `end_line`:
walk from the title, take numbered rows, stop at the next heading. 18 / 11 / 7 / 47 / 3 / 6, which
are the same six numbers the registry hardcodes. **The helper already exists and is already
called** - `_is_text_extent_boundary` recognises `### Line 19` today, and
`worksheet_harvest.py:733` does `continue` instead of `break`, stepping over it.

**AND THE HTML MAKES IT DETERMINISTIC.** Schedule D's HTML holds exactly **5 `<table>` elements and
every one is a worksheet**, each under a heading naming both worksheet and line
(`28% Rate Gain Worksheet-Line 18`). **The extent is a `</table>`.** The PDF-to-Markdown render
destroys that boundary, which is the whole reason this problem exists. The HTML also surfaces a
seventh worksheet the registry never had: **Capital Loss Carryover, Lines 6 and 14.**

**NEW FINDING, BIGGER THAN THIS ROUND: 170 OF 404 PRINTED ANCHORS (42%) DERIVE WITH AN EMPTY
INSTRUCTION PACKET.** Queued as item 1; ordering is John's call.


## Current round

**M20-S97 SPECCED BY ARCHITECT (2026-08-11). WORKSHEET EXTENTS COME FROM THE HTML, NOT FROM A
TABLE OF ANSWERS.** **REAL-PROJECT ROUND** - full-suite floor applies. Reworks `c9ee783`.

**WHY.** Three mechanisms have now been tried for one question, "where does this worksheet end":
a hardcoded phrase from one worksheet (`_contains_terminal_destination`), a destination cue the
Architect asserted and that does not hold, and a table of six frozen answers. **All three are the
same mistake** - guessing at printed prose to recover a boundary the source already states. The
acquired HTML states it: `</table>`.

**THE DIVISION OF AUTHORITY (John, 2026-08-11). This is the durable ruling of this round.**
**HTML is the STRUCTURAL authority** - table boundaries, the heading-to-line association, and the
stable `publink` anchors. **PDF-rendered Markdown is the PROSE authority** - reading text, page and
layout context. Neither is a substitute for the other and the harvester must stop treating them as
interchangeable. **All seven instruction booklets have both artifacts on hand today.**

**MEASURED EVIDENCE, 2026-08-11, so this is not a guess.** Visible-text volume matches across the
two renderings (ratio 0.88 to 1.16 over six booklets), so nothing material is hidden in the HTML or
lost from it - **the difference is structure, not content**. Schedule D's HTML holds exactly
**5 `<table>` elements and all 5 are worksheets**: Capital Loss Carryover (19 `<tr>`), 28% Rate Gain
(8), Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain (21), Schedule D Tax (38), Schedule D Tax Continued (23).

**THE TARGET STATE. Name it by what is GONE, because that is the check.**
1. **`SOURCE_VERIFIED_WORKSHEET_TARGETS` does not exist.** No worksheet's extent, line count, or
   constant count is written in Python.
2. **`WorksheetTarget.end_line` does not exist.**
3. **`_contains_terminal_destination` does not exist.** It encodes one worksheet's printed phrase.
4. **`harvest-worksheet` takes a document, not a curated target.** Given an instruction document id
   it returns EVERY worksheet in it. A title argument narrows the result; it is not required.
5. **`worksheet_harvest.py:733` breaks at a boundary instead of stepping over it.**

**THE MECHANISM, and the model earns its place here.** Extent comes from the `<table>` boundary -
deterministic, no call. **A model classifies each table**: worksheet, lookup table, or layout, plus
the printed line(s) it serves, read from its own heading. This is needed because Schedule D's 5
tables are all worksheets but **the 1040 has 200 tables** and most are EIC and tax lookups. **Do not
prefilter with a heuristic.** Send every table with its heading; roughly 230 tables corpus-wide is
small money on `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` and it is cached per acquisition. **A heuristic prefilter is
the same mistake in a new place.**

**THE ORACLE, and it costs nothing.** The deterministic PDF-Markdown walk - from the title, take
numbered rows, stop at the next heading - runs on every harvest and is REPORTED beside the HTML
answer. **Agreement is silent; disagreement is the review queue.** Verified 2026-08-11 to reproduce
all six extents (18 / 11 / 7 / 47 / 3 / 6) with no registry.

**A NAMED WORKSHEET IS ITS OWN DOCUMENT, however small** (John, 2026-08-09, AGENTS.md). The
classifier decides worksheet or not; **it never decides whether a worksheet is worth modelling.**

**WHO RUNS WHAT. The Worker's floor is reachable with NO network call - that is deliberate.**
- **WORKER, offline, and this is the whole round for Codex:** the `<table>` extent, the registry
  deletion, the `break` fix, the document-scoped CLI, the Markdown oracle, and the classifier built
  **behind the existing provider interface with a RECORDED-FIXTURE test**. Every floor clause below
  is deterministic and needs no live model.
- **ARCHITECT, live:** the one classification pass over the 1040's 200 tables. **Do not ask the
  Worker to run it.** Four rounds' floors have died on this: a file in the repo cannot authorize
  egress to an external provider, and Codex is right to refuse it - **only John can approve that in
  his own session.** If a round truly needs the Worker to make the call, John authorizes that one
  command interactively; it is never assumed.

**THE FLOOR. Prove it on the acquired corpus, not a fixture. No network call is required for any
clause here.**
- All six previously registered worksheets reproduce their extents **with the registry deleted**:
  Credit Limit 3, Exemption 6, Schedule D Tax 47, Simplified Method 11, 28% Rate Gain 7, Social
  Security Benefits 18.
- **Capital Loss Carryover (Lines 6 and 14) is found without being named.** The registry never had
  it; if the round cannot find it, the round has rebuilt the registry.
- **The CLI command that fails today succeeds**, with no `--start-anchor` and no title:
  `harvest-worksheet --source-document-id instructions_schedule_d_2025` returns 5 worksheets.
- **Schedule B returns zero worksheets and does not error.** Its HTML has 0 tables. An empty result
  is a correct answer, not a failure.
- The HTML and Markdown oracle agree on every extent, or each disagreement is printed with both
  numbers.

**OUT OF SCOPE - do not fold any of these in.**
- **Untitled computations** (the EIC `## Step N` blocks, and the untitled worksheet nested inside
  `Step 5 Earned Income`). Real, and they need the owning-line addressing settled first.
- **The 170 empty instruction packets.** Queue item 1, separate round.
- **Promotion and rederivation.** This round changes harvesting only. The 9 misread rows and 1040
  `6b` are cleared by the round AFTER this one.
- **The protected set stays byte-identical.** `git diff --stat` on `graph/2025/{nodes,edges,rules}/`
  and `graph/2025/field_maps/` must be EMPTY.

**M20-S97 REWORK WORKER STATUS (2026-08-11):** Fixed both Architect-measured defects. Discovery
still classifies all five Schedule D tables, but the continued table is absorbed into the base and
only four logical worksheet drafts are emitted; no duplicate 31-47 document is minted. The
classifier schema now asks only for worksheet/lookup/layout. Printed line tokens are derived from
each table's own heading, so Capital Loss is `6,14`, 28% Rate is `18`, and Unrecaptured 1250 is
`19` without model output. Added the retained-title ambiguity guard, and deleted exactly the three
obsolete S96 guards authorized below.

REAL-CORPUS FLOOR:
- Six old worksheet extents, with no registry, returned 3 / 6 / 47 / 11 / 7 / 18 lines and
  HTML/Markdown oracle agreement for Credit Limit, Exemption, Schedule D Tax, Simplified Method,
  28% Rate Gain, and Social Security Benefits.
- Schedule D HTML discovery classified all 5 tables; the base Schedule D Tax result combines its
  continuation to 47 lines and emits one logical draft. Capital Loss Carryover is discovered from
  its heading and anchor.
- Schedule B returned zero tables and zero worksheets without a classifier call.

TEST EVIDENCE:
RAN: `$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp_codex'; $env:PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE='1'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_worksheet_harvest_m20.py tests\test_worksheet_harvest_s97.py -q` -> **17 passed, 1 warning** (9 retained S96 guards plus 8 S97 tests).
RAN: `$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp_codex'; $env:PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE='1'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_nomination_s59.py tests\test_cli.py -q` -> **13 passed, 1 failed**; the remaining failure is `test_source_verified_worksheet_titles_keep_their_extent_contract`, which still asserts removed `target.end_line`.
RAN: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**.
RAN: no-bytecode compile of the changed harvester and retained/reworked focused test files -> **compile ok**.
RAN: `git diff --check` -> **clean**.
NOT RUN: provider classification leg; it would send acquired source-derived prompts to the external provider and was not authorized. NOT RUN: full suite; the remaining nomination guard migration is not authorized by the narrow S97 deletion list.

## Open for Architect

**S97 TEST CONTRACT MIGRATION - ANSWERED, AUTHORIZED, AND NARROWLY SCOPED.** Refusing to rewrite a
guard so it agrees with new code is the correct instinct and I do not want it relaxed. **This case
is different and here is the distinction: a guard whose CONTRACT was deleted is DELETED, never
rewritten to assert the replacement.** Rewriting it would launder a contract change into a passing
test; deleting it records honestly that the thing it protected no longer exists, and the S97 floor
is what replaces the coverage.

**DELETE exactly these three in `tests/test_worksheet_harvest_m20.py`** - they guard contracts this
round removes by name:
- `test_source_verified_worksheets_harvest_from_rendered_text_with_model_end_lines` (the registry)
- `test_model_selected_end_line_does_not_require_form_1040_destination` (`end_line`)
- `test_harvester_requires_terminal_destination_even_when_rows_are_contiguous`
  (`_contains_terminal_destination`)

**The other ten tests in that file MUST stay green and are NOT in scope to touch** - the QDCGT
canary, publink-id resilience, fail-closed on absent/ambiguous title, the `_drafts` writer guard,
the line-gap guard, stale-anchor title selection, title normalization, and the footnote-marker
guard. **If any of those ten needs editing to pass, that is a defect in the round, not a stale
guard - stop and report it.**

**REMAINING NOMINATION GUARD:** `tests/test_nomination_s59.py::test_source_verified_worksheet_titles_keep_their_extent_contract`
still asserts `WorksheetTarget.end_line`, which S97 removes. It is outside the three-file deletion
list above and is therefore left untouched pending explicit direction.


## Queued (ONE LINE each - do not spec ahead)

**JOHN'S PRIORITY, 2026-08-10: get the CORE documents processing reliably.** Ordered for that.
**Every item below is a PIPELINE change - none of them is a per-cell human correction.**

1. **170 OF 404 PRINTED ANCHORS (42%) DERIVE WITH AN EMPTY INSTRUCTION PACKET** (Architect,
   measured 2026-08-11 on the production path, `for_line` at `cells.py:291`). Per form empty:
   6251 61%, schedule_d 54%, 2441 45%, schedule_a 32%, 1040 29%, schedule_3 23%, schedule_2 16%,
   schedule_1 13% - and **schedule_1a and schedule_b are 100%, all 56 anchors, zero sections**.
   **Not a parser bug: `instruction_sections` creates a slice only under a heading that NAMES a
   form line**, and Schedule B and Schedule 1-A organise their booklets by Part and topic
   (`Part I. Interest`, `No Tax on Tips`), naming no lines. **HTML does not fix it** - the same
   headings appear there, so this is the IRS's organisation, not our rendering. Same defect family
   as S97: keying on a printed cue and silently dropping everything the cue misses.
   **NOT YET SHOWN: that filling these packets raises `derived`.** A row can derive off the form
   face alone. **Test it with a live A/B on a handful of rows, not replay** - replay reuses the
   recorded prompt. **Ordering against S97 is John's call.**
2. **UNTITLED COMPUTATIONS THAT CARRY WORKSHEET WEIGHT** (Architect, 2026-08-11). The EIC
   `## Step N` blocks compute real quantities - `Step 2 Investment Income` sums 1040 `2a`+`2b`+`3b`
   +`7a` with a floor rule and an $11,950 threshold - but have no title and no local line numbers,
   and `Step 5 Earned Income` contains an **untitled worksheet** whose lines 1-5 interleave with the
   surrounding question numbering. **This is the other half of the 4-row validator-scope cluster**
   (1040 `5a`, `5b`, `27a`, 2441 `10`): unharvested because there is no title to key on.
   **Proposed rule: a printed address decides.** Titled and line-numbered becomes a document;
   untitled becomes an intermediate node owned by the line it feeds. **The false-positive fixture is
   Schedule D `Wash Sales`**, a numbered list 1-4 that is conditions, not arithmetic.
3. **STUBS FOR OUT-OF-CORPUS FORMS, and fix the `Form(s) X` alias.** 1040 `25c` hard-fails because
   the evidence says "Form(s) W-2G" and the matcher builds `form w2g`. Same "(s)" quirk that spared
   1040 `1a` from the reference guard.
4. **A LEAF MEANING "SUPPLIED HERE".** The only genuinely NEW vocabulary; needs the enum gate.
   Blocks 2441 `5`, where `REQUIRE_INPUT` is legal as a whole rule but not as a lookup branch.
5. **SKIP HUMAN-VERIFIED CELLS ON RERUN** - the step S94 deliberately left out. It must read the
   review ledger, **not a prior run's status**, because re-deriving an approved cell could silently
   replace an approved answer.
6. **Repair calls that return an unchanged payload** must be detected and not spent (2441 `5`).
7. **`CASE` / alternation** - still HELD; revisit with the wide-run evidence.
8. **"Report issue" from a reviewer corrective** (John, 2026-08-10) - optional and **never hidden**;
   emit a ready-to-paste GitHub body, no network and no auth to maintain. **Cluster by failure kind
   and answer shape, not by form**, so 50 reports of one cause collapse into one issue. Derivation
   runs on BLANK forms so the payload carries no filer data; **the reviewer's own comment is the one
   field needing a preview before sending.** Product work - after the core set is reliable.
9. **Housekeeping:** `pilot/context_arms.py` still scores `REQUIRE_INPUT` as a recovered formula;
   run-together instruction headings (`**Line 2dDepletion**`) - **now explained: a PDF-render
   artifact, the HTML separates them cleanly (`28% Rate Gain Worksheet-Line 18`), so S97's division
   of authority may retire this**; artifact-pinned test counts measured
   against untracked `.cache/raw`; `form_8949_2025` needs table-form treatment (4 anchors, 0
   admitted); 2441 `19`/`21`/`25` are a KNOWN-UNSTABLE set - do not read them as signal.

**REPORT EVERY ROUND WITH `pilot/run_report.py`** - per-document coverage against every printed
anchor, plus a row-level floor check. Validated against four real runs.

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\run_report.py <RUN> --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_rest --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_run
```

**TEST FIXES ONE CELL AT A TIME, NOT WITH A CORPUS RUN.**
`rederive_cell(document_id, line, draft_comment)` is a discrete call - cents and seconds.
`pilot/row_bench.py` replays a recorded row for free. **An hour-long run to check a handful of rows
is not acceptable** (John, 2026-08-10).


## Standing operational notes

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-08; M20-S84 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot review page now has one full-width Tree and Math column. The retired positional renderer,
flow-only summary fields, SVG output, moderator-role constant, arrow glyph, and flow-only CSS/data
are removed from `pilot/review_panel.py`. Tree headers are left aligned, child indentation is
32px, and informative graph roles remain while position-implied roles stay suppressed. Holes
render their stored reason: the real cand_s71 workspace reports 83 `selector_no_formula_cue`, 7
structural, and 2 derivation rows. `--top N` ranks by operation count then operand count and keeps
the full 157-anchor totals in the summary. Default output is `C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`.
The root `.gitignore` now ignores only `.test_tmp/` and ignores the empty root `tmp/` directory.

**S84 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py 'C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71' --output C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`
-> **157 anchors; 65 operation rows; operation counts 1: 51, 2: 12, 6: 2; 92 holes; hole reasons
83 selector_no_formula_cue / 7 structural / 2 derivation; max operands 23**. RAN the same command
with `--top 14` and `--top 25` -> **14 and 25 rendered operation rows respectively**, with the
full 157-anchor summary retained. The generated full page has **zero** `flow-svg`, `flow-edge`,
`MODERATOR_ROLES`, and `<svg` occurrences. Role counts are unchanged from the pre-S84 page, and
the longest Math line is **392 characters before and after**. Form 6251 line 18 renders as a Tree
with `threshold`, `key`, and `filing status` present.

**S84 TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; $env:M20_S73_CANDIDATE='C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **13 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; $env:M20_S73_CANDIDATE='C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot -q`
-> **34 passed, 1 warning**. RAN `.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py`
-> **ASCII check OK**. The warning is the known permission failure writing the pre-existing
`.pytest_cache`; no provider run and no full suite were performed, per pilot rules.

**How to rebuild a candidate** - the two commands, in order, because the second is worthless
without a run from current code:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe experiments\derive_cells_s25.py --year 2025 --output-dir <RUN> --document form_1040_2025 --document form_2441_2025 --document form_6251_2025
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tax_graph.cli regenerate-candidate --run-dir <RUN> --output-dir <CAND> --expected-document form_1040_2025 --expected-document form_2441_2025 --expected-document form_6251_2025
```

**ONE RED IS OURS, and S64's evidence mislabelled it.**
`tests/test_m20_s31.py::test_all_prompt_templates_render_with_representative_values` fails with
`ValueError: prompt has unsupported placeholder: operation_documentation`. The Worker recorded it as
an "existing prompt fixture omission"; it is not existing. **It PASSES at `origin/main` (26eead7)
and fails on our tree**, because S66 added `<<operation_documentation>>` to `prompts/derive_cells.md`
without adding the token to the test's representative values. The pipeline path itself is fine - the
canary derived 65 rows through that same template - so this is the pinned vocabulary contract test
going red, not a product defect. Fix is the fixture, not the prompt.

**The other 20 are pre-existing**, established by A/B against `origin/main` in a worktree with the
local `.cache`, `graph/2025/_drafts`, and `build/` junctioned in so the comparison is fair: 3 fail
identically on a bare checkout, 5 more fail identically once the artifacts are present, and all 11
`tests/e2e/*_m15` fail identically with an empty review queue (0 documents, the known stale-queue
condition). `tests/test_review_scope_migration_m15.py` is UNCOMPARABLE - it skips at baseline for
missing 2441 extension artifacts and fails on ours, so it is untriaged, not cleared.

**Full suite on our tree: 21 failed, 841 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed.**

**PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT must be a SHORT path.** A run rooted under the Claude session scratchpad
produced **70 failures across 28 files**, every one of them `shutil.Error ... [WinError 3]` from
MAX_PATH overflow while copying `graph/2025/_drafts` into the fixture project. The same tests pass
on `C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\tgpt`. A long temp root does not fail a few tests, it fails
whole files at once - that shape is the signature, not a code regression.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; awaiting Architect acceptance).** M20-S70 is implemented under
`pilot/` as `cell_access.py`, the rewired `review_panel.py` and `constructions/measure.py`, their
tests, and README updates. `CellText.value is None` is typed absence; the label accessor reads
`label_after` only, so an absent caption cannot fall through to candidate or anchor text. The
accessor also owns form-face, instruction, expression, rendered wording, findings, status, and
graph operand reads. No provider was run and no candidate or graph artifact was written.

**REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_review_panel.html`
-> **157 anchors; 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none; 92 holes; captions 8 present / 149 absent;
instruction sections 17 present / 140 absent; operations 65 present / 92 absent**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\constructions\measure.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_constructions.yaml`
-> **construction inventory written**. The panel invariant covers all 157 anchors and no returned
caption begins and ends with the same printed line token.

**TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; M20-S72 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot now stops graph expansion at nested plain form-line references, renders them as `line X`,
and hashes repeated operation subtrees so later occurrences say `same expression as above`.
Column 3 emits no graph node ids; the `zero_floor` modelling oddity remains reported in the
summary and the graph is unchanged. `build_panel` records per-panel arrow counts and their
distribution. The summary and CLI now call the accessor-resolved count **instruction rows**;
the S71 candidate has 17 such rows (4/8/5 by document) and 16 unique locators. The alleged 84
rows is not present in this candidate's 67 `rows_detail` records, so no second section count is
carried into the panel. Changes are limited to `pilot/` and pilot tests/docs.

**S72 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN against the S71 candidate at the path above. Before the fix,
45 diagram/chain panels had distribution `{4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 2, 11: 2,
12: 1, 13: 1, 14: 1, 16: 3, 17: 1, 18: 2, 19: 1, 20: 1, 23: 2, 24: 1, 26: 2, 27: 1,

with max 251 and modes 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none. After the fix, distribution is
`{4: 9, 5: 2, 6: 1, 16: 2, 17: 1}`, max 17, with modes 4 diagrams / 11 chains / 142 none.
The residual max 17 is still above the rough dozen target and is reported plainly; further
notation/CSE work remains queued. The 157 generated flow sections contain no node-id leakage.

## Open for Architect

**S92 [DONE] WORKER STATUS (2026-08-09), commit `6833dad`:** Implemented `pilot/row_bench.py` and
`pilot/test_row_bench.py`. Replay is read-only and uses the production `_render_cell_prompt`,
`_apply_payload`, and `validate_cell_output`; live mode delegates to production `derive_cells`
while capturing its prompts and responses. No production code, prompt, validator, graph, or
review state changed.

**THE 15-ROW GROUPING IS CONFIRMED WITH ONE CORRECTION.** The embedded-worksheet validator
pattern is 1040 `5a`, `5b`, `27a`, and 2441 `10`; 1040 line `10` is derived and is not in the
15-row error set. The 1040 rows carry 11,424 and 43,748 character instruction packets that
embed Simplified Method and EIC worksheets. 2441 line 10 carries the Credit Limit Worksheet;
its internal line 3 says subtract line 2 from line 1, which the parent-row validator reads as
the row rule. This is the same validator scope defect, with a different worksheet.

The remaining groups match the spec: quote-not-verbatim on 1040 `3b`, `35a`; expression grammar
payload rejection on 1040 `12e`, 2441 `5`; unknown external document on 1040 `25c`, 6251 `8`;
source-side no-call evidence gaps on 2441 `8`, 6251 `1a`; line-format mismatch on 6251 `2h`,
`2`; and self-reference on 1040 `38`. Replay confirms first and repair payloads are rejected
under the same production validator for every provider-reached row.

Two source-backed qualifications are recorded. For 6251 `2`, printed `1z` is present in the
1040 field inventory, address map, and binding, but is absent from the promoted semantic node
inventory used by `build_reference_inventory`; the hard failure is therefore a graph inventory
shape gap, not a missing form control. For 6251 `8`, the acquired 6251 instructions do name
Form 1116, but the row's joined instruction text is empty, so the current payload is not
source-backed in the packet the model received and the hard failure is correct until that join
is fixed.

The 15 replay screens were produced from `C:\tmp\m20_s91b\run`; no provider leg was run. **ANSWERED - THREE DISTINCT FIXES, AND NONE OF THEM IN PRODUCTION YET.** Both of your
qualifications are Architect-verified: the reference inventory holds **42** printed lines for 1040
and `1z` is **not** among them (no node id contains it), and 6251 `2` and `8` both have **zero**
instruction characters. Your correction to my grouping is accepted - the worksheet cluster is 1040
`5a`, `5b`, `27a` and 2441 `10`; **1040 `10` was my error, it derives.**

**1. VALIDATOR SCOPE is the big one (4 rows), but "scope it to the row's own instruction section"
is not the rule** - the worksheet IS inside the row's own section. The rule is: **line-number
references inside an embedded worksheet block are the WORKSHEET's, not the parent row's.** The
blocks are titled ("Simplified Method Worksheet", "Credit Limit Worksheet"), so the boundary is
findable.
**2. INSTRUCTION JOINS** - 6251 `2` and `8` receive an empty packet. Upstream, separate.
**3. PROMOTED-NODE INVENTORY** - `1z` exists as a form line but not as a node the validator will
accept. Same family as the stub work.

**PROVE EACH ONE IN THE HARNESS FIRST. NO PRODUCTION CHANGE UNTIL A FIX IS DEMONSTRATED THERE.**
That is John's standing direction for this effort and replay mode makes it free: **extend
`row_bench.py` to take an experimental validator variant and report which of the 15 rows flip to
accepted.** A fix that cannot move a row in replay does not belong in `tax_graph/`.
model-quality change.

**S91b WORKER STATUS (2026-08-09):** Implemented the provider-free strict-substring extension to
the printed-bracket clause selector. `clean_form_face_text_with_extent` keeps the near-empty-face
rule and now also selects the bracket when the normalized fallback face is a strict substring of
the bracket face. `clause_extent` records `selection_reason` as `weak_fallback`,
`fallback_strict_substring`, or `fallback` alongside both candidate faces and the disagreement
direction. The real 2025 corpus selects **68** rows: the prior **42** weak-face repairs plus **26**
strict-substring repairs. The disagreement split remains **44 bracket-longer / 27 fallback-longer**.

**S91 WORKER STATUS (2026-08-09):** Implemented the provider-free printed-bracket clause extent
selection. `_bracketed_source_text` uses neighboring indexed printed anchors, accepts a full anchor
or its trailing letter as the start, strips dot-leader-only rows, and ends at the full anchor. The
cell layer keeps the existing geometry cleanup as fallback, selects the bracket only for a weak
projected face when it is not shorter, and records both faces, selection method, and disagreement
direction in `clause_extent` metadata. The real 2025 corpus selected **42** repairs; the measured
disagreement split is **44 bracket-longer / 27 fallback-longer**. The cited good-face cases remain
on fallback where the bracket would over-capture.

stale real S90c report now regenerates successfully. The candidate writer accepts a shared node id
when its identity payload agrees across documents (citation provenance may differ), rejects a real
payload collision, and synthesizes canonical document/line stubs for valid edge endpoints missing
from a partial candidate. The document-only external-reference predicate now lets the model obtain
the line from the external document while requiring source evidence to name the document.
Instructions booklets remain named `instructions_document_operand` findings and never mint stubs.

NOT RUN: full suite; it exceeds the Worker command cap and the graph-validator copy ACL family remains environment-red.

**S90b PREREQUISITE (2026-08-09):** Committed at `ad53a97`; its evidence-backed
out-of-inventory operands now produce the non-fatal `unresolved_external_reference` warning,
retain the structured `unresolved_external_nodes` record, remain `derived` without consuming a
repair, and are copied into candidate-row findings for the review surface. Unsourced unknown
documents remain hard `operand_document_not_found` failures. W-2, every 1099 suffix, and K-1 face
references are excluded from the REQUIRE_INPUT guard as filer-supplied information returns.

**ANSWERED - THAT GUARD IS SUPERSEDED. Rewrite it; the implementation is right.** You were right
to stop. `test_named_unseen_form_reference_mints_unresolved_external_node` is an **S74** guard, not
an S90 one, and its fixture is the exact case S90b redefines: the face reads "Attach Form 4684 and
enter the amount from line 18 of that form", so the reference is evidence-backed and Form 4684 is
simply outside the corpus. **Failing that row closed is the behaviour that cost 27 rows.**

**Replacement assertions.** Status `derived`, not `error`. **Exactly ONE provider call** - the
repair must not be consumed. `unresolved_external_reference` present in
`validator_warnings_by_kind`, `operand_document_not_found` ABSENT, `gapped == 0`. **Keep the
`unresolved_external_nodes` payload assertion byte-for-byte** - that record is what S74 actually
bought and S90b does not change it.

**Add the complementary guard in the same file, so the pair is visible:** an operand naming a
document the row's own evidence does NOT name stays a hard `operand_document_not_found` with
status `error`. That is the line `_legitimate_external_reference` draws, and reusing that existing
predicate rather than inventing a second one was the right call.

**The information-return rule is verified on real rows.** Architect ran it against the S89 corpus:
flagged rows drop **12 -> 11**, `form_6251_2025` line 2j is correctly no longer flagged, and
synthetic faces "from Form W-2, box 1", "from Form(s) W-2", "from Form 1099-R, box 1", "from Form
1099-DIV" and the K-1 face all read as inputs while "from Form 8863, line 8" still flags. **By
family, not by spelling, as specced.**

**The live leg was not run by the Worker.** S90b acceptance still rested on it: coverage back to at least
139 of 157, `form_6251_2025` line 13 back to `max(qdcgt line 4, 0)`, and the 64 plus 13 intact.

NOT RUN: live provider leg; requires the network-capable acceptance context.

**S90b acceptance remains a network-capable Architect check:** verify that the 12 S89 input rows
are repaired into cross-document operands or named unresolved-reference findings, with no silent
`REQUIRE_INPUT` result. S90c adds the candidate-graph stub and lifecycle gate above.

**S89 is accepted; its items are cleared. The record is `d2a077f` and the BALL block.**

**S85 Part C is open for the Architect:** the fresh three-document run used the pinned
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna` model but all 34 attempted rows failed with
`LlmUnavailable: OpenRouter request failed: Connection error.` The regenerated candidate is
empty of rules, so Form 6251 line 18 execution and the real-data comparator/checkbox proof remain
unverified. Rerun Part C in a network-capable context; no authorization escalation is needed. The
Worker also could not create or write under `C:\tmp` in this sandbox, so the mandated panel path
needs verification there. S86 remains after the full-suite result.

**S86 worker verification is open for Architect:** the impacted worker slice is 139 passed with 9
environment failures, all `WinError 5` while `test_examples_m8.py` and
`test_nversion_m8.py` copy ACL-protected `graph/2025/_drafts/` directories. The model accessor,
attribution, doctor, extraction, re-derivation, batch, prompt experiment, extension, workbench, and
offline example slices passed. Run the full suite against the known 20 baseline and verify the
provider leg in a network-capable context; the Worker did not run either under the 600-second cap.

The three items `doctor` flagged STALE at 73 commits on
2026-08-05 are closed: the **S36 denominator decision** (moot - S51 replaced the denominator
with 121 of 478 anchors and a named reason per skip); the **two scoping calls** (worksheets
closed by the S59 nomination chain; the filing-status constant answered by measurement -
`schedule_1a_2025` line 17 and `form_6251_2025` line 18 both emit correct role-keyed lookups);
and **"what is next"** (John chose option (b), structure and association, on 2026-08-05).

**Open for JOHN, not blocking:** during bootstrap, "every cell receives meaningful human
approval before use" and "a human does not read every new cell" cannot both hold. The pipeline
can eliminate RE-review - approve once against stable semantics, fingerprint the clauses, carry
the verdict while nothing changes - but not first review. That decision shapes S53.

pruned from 7,520 lines on 2026-08-02 at S28 acceptance; `git show 12240ef:plans/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
is the last unpruned copy. Earlier prune: 2026-07-23, from 1,198 lines, for public-repo prep.
Durable rulings were carried forward into **Binding rulings** above rather than deleted; A9
