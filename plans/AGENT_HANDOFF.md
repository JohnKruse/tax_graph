# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

The single living doc for active Claude (Architect) <-> Codex (Worker) coordination. Update it in
place; do NOT spawn new per-topic note files. Standing rules: `../AGENTS.md`. Master plan:
`../docs/engineering-plan.md`.

## How to use
- **Worker:** raise questions/blocks under **Open for Architect**.
- **Architect:** answer there (and pin durable decisions into the relevant `PHASE_<id>.md`), then
  clear the item. Record active direction under **From Architect**.
- Keep it short - move resolved items to **Resolved** or delete them.
- History: pruned at each phase close (latest: M14 close 2026-07-12). Full narration lives in
  `plans/archive/` (phase plans with close notes) and git history.

## Current state (2026-07-12)

**BALL: ARCHITECT.** M14 (Product surface, canary Open Door) is COMPLETE and archived
(`plans/archive/PHASE_M14.md`); all five steps [DONE], every exit criterion met with real
live passes. What M14 landed: serve-lifecycle hardening (parent watchdog - fixed twice on
Windows, orphan sweep dogfooded live); packaging (wheel with embedded runtime assets,
.mcpb bundle that ships the WHEEL and never source-builds, server.json, tag/dispatch
release workflow with a triple-gated inert publish job - dry run green in CI); the
self-serve extension harness (overlay + collision hard-error, gate: project|user
provenance axis end to end, content-hash no-impersonation proven by live tamper,
extend doctor/run/accept/package, form_2441 pilot accepted as an honest user-gated T0
island); and intake v1 (three additive relevance kinds with verbatim re-mined citations
from acquired sources, 90-box + 13614-C inventories enforced in validate, deterministic
local classifier over committed fixtures, fail-closed consent, intake CLI + MCP tools,
Return Record provenance). The in-app Claude Desktop live pass closed Step 2
triple-witnessed: John's chat, the Architect's pre-verified engine run, and the
Architect's direct call to the extension server (MFS loss-limit scenario:
line 16 = -4500, line 21 = -1500, 1040 line 7 = -1500).
**Next: M15 (Review Workbench + review campaign, canary Fresh Eyes) - THE PRE-SHIP
GATE.** Architect writes `PHASE_M15.md` just-in-time per the roadmap; the review queue
below is its raw material. Year rollover (TY2026) stays sequenced after M15 or when
TY2026 docs drop.
(Whoever finishes a turn: update this BALL line - it is the first thing read.)

- **M0-M14 are COMPLETE and archived** (see `plans/archive/`, each with a close note).
- **THE GRAPH COMPUTES TAX, FILES IT, AND IS STAGED TO SHIP (alpha).** Computation and
  witnesses through M13 (line 16 under OTS + IRS adjudication over the widened Schedule D
  domain; filled official PDFs; return-scoped outputs). M14 added the product surface:
  installable artifacts, extension harness, intake v1.
- **John-only distribution checklist (post-close actions; artifacts staged + verified):**
  1. Configure PyPI trusted publishing for project `tax-graph` (repo `JohnKruse/tax_graph`,
     workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml`, environment `pypi`) at
     https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/, then GitHub Actions -> "Release alpha
     artifacts" -> Run workflow with `publish_pypi=true` (the ONLY route that enables the
     publish job).
  2. Download the `.mcpb` artifact from that run, install in Claude Desktop, then submit
     the tested bundle through the Connectors Directory. UX hazards to note in the
     submission and/or file as Anthropic app feedback: extensions install DISABLED with a
     tiny enable link; a config-file dev server with a near-identical name is invisible
     in the Extensions UI (twin-name collision confused testing); per-server logs record
     handshakes but not tools/call.
  3. After the PyPI release is visible: `mcp-publisher login github` then `mcp-publisher
     publish` from the repo to publish `server.json`; verify the
     `io.github.johnkruse/tax-graph` listing at registry.modelcontextprotocol.io.
- **Review queue (M15's raw material):** M10/M11 promotion entries; M12's 11
  field_map_review entries; QDCGT worksheet (high); deduction decision node (TOP); M13's
  Schedule D Tax Worksheet + line-20 decision; `extension_review_form_2441_2025`
  (accepted_local, machine_agreed: false - first review items: the two cross-gate hookup
  edges and the failed Part II math, see archived Step-3 findings A/B); 3 intake_review_*
  entries (routing/triggers/expectations). `human_minutes` stays honestly null until M15.
- **Carried-forward named gaps (M13 Option B; see `plans/archive/PHASE_M13.md` Step 4):**
  (1) PolicyEngine liability witness pending - widen `scenario_inputs_from_facts`, live PE
  over the `m6_seed1315` corpus, refreeze `pe_liability_2025.json`, re-enable the two
  skipped tests; do NOT claim dual-witness on the widened domain until then. (2)
  parameter-diff HoH top-bracket floor (626350 cited vs 375800 fixture) - source review,
  never edit the cited graph parameter without it.
- **Standing rules (cumulative):** ASCII only (pre-push hook `.githooks/pre-push` +
  CI enforce; enable per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`); hermetic
  tests - no `_drafts` reads, no shared `build/` artifacts (tmp sqlite), and a machine
  with an installed extension IS the normal dev state (use
  `Graph(..., include_extensions=False)` for shipped-content parity); **close-out
  ordering: `frontier build` FIRST, `verify record` SECOND, commit together** (the
  content hash covers frontier.yaml); full suite green is the commit floor; **CI on the
  pushed commit must be green at every step commit and phase close** (watch it - do not
  skip for "docs-only" changes, the ASCII gate bites those too); live-execution passes
  for anything an outside tool/user consumes; drafts never committed; base-deps light;
  citations are verbatim-from-acquired-source ONLY - `check_citation_integrity` has
  teeth, use it (the M14 fabricated-citations reopen is the precedent); John-only
  outward actions - no agent publishes, submits, or uploads.
- **Recurring op note:** orphaned `serve` processes now have first-class tooling -
  `tax-graph serve --sweep-orphans` (dogfooded live on a real orphan). The parent
  watchdog works on Windows as of M14 (OpenProcess probe; the os.kill(pid,0) probe was
  inert). Serve writes stderr breadcrumbs (`tax-graph serve: starting/...`) that Claude
  Desktop logs verbatim - first stop when a client-managed server dies.
- **Worker-attribution (tier metrics), M14:** Steps 1-5 implemented by Codex (GPT 5.6
  Luna, Xtra High); Architect (Opus 4.8) verified every step and fixed in-line: the
  .mcpb source-build defect + repack, the inert Windows watchdog + real-process tests,
  serve breadcrumbs, the Step-1 shared-sqlite hermetic violation, the Step-4 reopen
  (fabricated citations - Luna re-mined honestly), the parity include_extensions fix,
  and the Step-5 record-hash ordering fix. Step 2's live pass was John + Architect.

## Open for Architect
- (none)

## From Architect
- **M15 planning is next.** The workbench builds against the FINAL artifact shape
  (docs/review-workbench.md + M12's node-to-page geometry); the campaign drains the
  queue above and measures real `human_minutes` / escape rates; verdict outcomes
  distinguish confirmed / pipeline-defect / source-pathology per engineering-plan. It is
  the pre-ship gate: the alpha may be name-claimed on PyPI before it, but nothing is
  promoted as usable-stable until M15 passes.
- **Extension-iteration backlog (M15-adjacent, from the pilot):** one-pass `extend` on
  math-bearing forms yields honest T0 structure without passing worksheet math; the
  review loop needs an iterate/author-in-review story. Named limitation documented in
  `docs/self-serve-extension.md`.

## Latest verification
- **M14 phase close (Architect, Opus 4.8, 2026-07-12) - ALL GREEN:**
  - Full suite in the DIRTY checkout (pilot extension installed): 318 passed, 6 skipped;
    simulated-clean (worker): 315 passed, 9 skipped (3 skips named in docs/intake.md)
  - `pytest -m m14` -> 22 passed; `validate` green (18 documents incl. intake sources);
    frontier 79 modeled / 5 declared, byte-stable; records byte-stable after the
    hash-ordering fix; ASCII green
  - Live passes: fresh-venv wheel (validate/run/build/sqlite-run + stdio MCP handshake);
    in-app Claude Desktop .mcpb install + MFS loss-limit round trip (triple-witnessed,
    dev server removed from config during the test and restored after); registry schema
    validation; release workflow CI dry run SUCCESS (publish job inert); form_2441
    extension pilot (tamper -> loud hash-mismatch failure); intake CLI example
  - Pushed-commit CI green at every step commit through `b13467e`; close commit CI
    watched on push
- Prior phase closes: `plans/archive/PHASE_M13.md` (and earlier) - each with a close note.

## Resolved / superseded
- M14 items (packaging defects, watchdog, fabricated-citations reopen, pilot findings,
  hash-ordering rule): `plans/archive/PHASE_M14.md` header + git history.
- M13 items (S1_21 ruling, SDTW gate-defect adjudication, Option B): `plans/archive/PHASE_M13.md`.
- Pre-M13: `plans/archive/` phase plans and prior handoff snapshots.
