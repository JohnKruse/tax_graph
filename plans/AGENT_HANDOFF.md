# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

The single living doc for active Claude (Architect) <-> Codex (Worker) coordination. Update it in
place; do NOT spawn new per-topic note files. Standing rules: `../AGENTS.md`. Master plan:
`../docs/engineering-plan.md`. Phase plan: `PHASE_M20.md`.

## How to use
- **Worker:** raise questions/blocks under **Open for Architect**.
- **Architect:** answer there (and pin durable decisions into the relevant `PHASE_<id>.md`), then
  clear the item. Record active direction under **From Architect**.
- **THIS FILE IS LIVE STATE ONLY.** The ball, the round in flight, the open questions, and the
  ONE task spec being worked. Durable rulings and standing constraints live in `../AGENTS.md`
  and are never pruned. History lives in git. **Queued future rounds are ONE LINE each** - a
  full spec written rounds ahead goes stale, which is exactly what happened to S57.
- **Keep it short.** A round that completes gets its narration DELETED, not appended - the
  accepted hash is the record and `git show <hash>` recovers everything. Only the current round,
  the standing constraints, and the binding rulings live here.
- **Prune at every acceptance, not "at phase close".** Pruned 2026-07-23 to 1,198 lines, then
  grew to 7,520 by 2026-08-02 because acceptance never triggered a prune. That is the failure
  mode this section exists to prevent.

## BALL

**BALL: ARCHITECT - no round in flight. John is choosing the review-panel layout.**
**S81 ACCEPTED at `c89dd53`; temperature pinned at `50a64bf`.**
**Full suite 2026-08-07: 20 failed, 851 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed in 0:57:21** - exactly the
known pre-existing set, zero new failures, passes 850 -> 851 on S81's own tests.

**2441 LINE 25 DERIVES after nine failed runs**, and the encoding sidesteps a gap we thought was
blocking: `max(0, if_else(line 22, 0, min(line 20, line 21), min(line 20, line 21) - line 24))`.
It tests **line 22 against 0** rather than needing a boolean predicate, using the form's own
structure - checking "No" makes line 22 read -0-, checking "Yes" makes it an amount. **Its
correctness still rests on the unstored comparator**, the same gap measured across 36 anchors.

**NEW DEFECT, from S74's inventory being too broadly scoped.** `form_6251_2025` line 13 now derives
`max(qdcgt line 4, instructions_schedule_d_2025 line 13, 0)` - an operand pointing at an
**instructions booklet**. A formula may reference forms and worksheets; it must never reference an
instructions document. Scope the inventory and make an instructions-document operand a named
finding.

**TEMPERATURE IS PINNED TO 0, AND THE CONFIG LINE ALONE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT.**
`derive_cells` was called without a `temperature` argument, so the derivation path used the
parameter default of `None` and never read `llm.temperature` - while `generator.py`, `critic.py`,
`micro.py` and `background.py` all did. Fixed, and the helper preserves an explicit zero because
**`0` is falsy** and a truthiness test would have discarded the pin silently. Live-verified that
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna` accepts it. **Caveats recorded in the example config:** this reduces variance
without removing it (batched inference is not bit-deterministic), and `allow_fallbacks: true` means
a routed endpoint may still reject or ignore it.

**BASELINE RESET. EVERY CROSS-RUN COMPARISON MADE BEFORE 2026-08-07 IS UNATTRIBUTABLE.** All prior
runs sampled at the provider default, so diffs conflated real change with sampling noise - including
the 2441 "1 error -> 4 errors" and `form_1040_2025` line 35a going `repaired -> error` under S81.
**Do not attribute those.** The next canary at temperature 0 is the new reference run.
**Prefer invariants that hold on ANY single run over diffs between two runs.**

**S74 ACCEPTED at `b153e94`. S75 ACCEPTED at `b2982c6`.**
**Full suite 2026-08-07: 20 failed, 850 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed in 0:57:34** - exactly the
known pre-existing set, **zero new failures**, passes 846 -> 850 on S74's own tests.

**S74's acceptance test half-passed, and the other half was my error.** `form_6251_2025` line 13 now
derives `max(qualified_dividends_capital_gain_tax_worksheet line 4, 0)` - correct document, correct
line; the document inventory did its job. **Line 20 was never a wrong answer.** Its full text offers
three alternatives and ends *"If you did not complete either worksheet... enter the amount from Form
1040 or 1040-SR, line 15; if zero or less, enter -0-"*. It derived `max(form_1040_2025 line 15, 0)` -
the third branch, stated verbatim, floor included. S74 still improved it: yesterday it said
`form_1040_nr_2025`, the wrong filer's form. **The corpus now has ZERO known wrong references**; what
remains on line 20 is a three-way "whichever applies" the grammar cannot hold, which belongs with
named intermediates.

**UNRESOLVED and honest:** 2441 moved from 1 error to 4 (`self_reference` line 5,
`incomplete_evidence` line 8, `quote_not_verbatim` line 21, the standing line 25). The baseline run
predates BOTH S71 and S74, so the delta cannot be attributed without a third run. All four fail for
stated reasons rather than repairing into something unverifiable.
Active spec is under Current round. **S76 IS DEFERRED to queue position 1** (John, 2026-08-07);
**the S74 suite has FINISHED, so `tax_graph/` is free and S76 is unblocked whenever John wants it.**
John's arc, 2026-08-07: **fix column 1, then assess column 2, and column 3 should then fall out.**
S76 is the column-1 fix reaching production.

**S71 ACCEPTED at `e79f2cd`; S70 at `977e977`; S72 at `b18d9f1`; S73 at `78516bc`.**

**INSTRUCTION COVERAGE IS SETTLED: 84 of 153 candidate rows (55%)**, not 17. S73 found the cause -
the panel **discarded candidate rows whenever the denominator anchor carried a `skip_reason`** - and
a second alignment defect alongside it: the admitted `form_2441_2025` line 21 candidate was being
consumed by the preceding skipped header duplicate. Per document: **17/59 on 1040, 18/33 on 2441,
24/61 on 6251.** Verified independently by the Architect; S72's 17-arrow ceiling and S70/S71's
clean text both held, and 15 pilot tests pass.
**Full suite: 20 failed, 846 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed in 1:01:19.** Those 20 are EXACTLY the
known pre-existing set minus `test_m20_s31`, which S71's sibling commit fixed - **zero new
failures**, and passes rose 841 -> 846 on S71's own tests. The 20 were triaged against
`origin/main` earlier with local artifacts junctioned in; 11 are `tests/e2e/*_m15` failing on an
empty review queue, the rest are artifact-state driven. `test_review_scope_migration_m15` remains
UNCOMPARABLE (skips at baseline) and is untriaged, not cleared.

**S71 verified on the real corpus:** 153 of 153 rows carry clean form-face text (was 67), 0 of 194
node labels carry the raw-OCR signature (was 46 of 232), coverage unchanged.
**S70 verified:** 0 of 157 panels render a raw label, down from 72; absence renders as absence.
**S70 carries one open defect into S72**: the panel reports 17 instruction sections present while
84 rows carry instruction text.

**S64 is ACCEPTED at `7189375`; S67 is ACCEPTED at `bb3daca`.**

**A candidate graph now exists.** Rebuilt from a fresh canary run: **194 nodes, 233 edges, 72 rules,
66 citations** across the three documents, with **65 of 67 attempted rows entering the candidate**
(61 derived, 4 repaired) and 2 held back as `review_gap` - one `quote_not_verbatim` on 2441, one
`self_reference` on 6251. Both are named findings, never silent drops.

**The first S64 measurement was invalid and the mistake is worth keeping.** The Architect ran the
candidate writer against the `s67-live` reports, which were produced BEFORE S64 taught
`derive_cells_s25.py` to carry `quote` and `quote_span_id` into `rows_detail`. Every derived row
therefore arrived with no citation, the pairing gate correctly demoted all 62, and the candidate came
out structurally empty - 0 nodes for every real document. **A run is only evidence for the code that
produced it.** Re-run derivation before measuring anything that consumes a report.

**Live: 67 attempted, 61 derived, 4 repaired, 2 errored.** `form_1040_2025` **17/17 with zero
repairs**, 2441 **20/21**, 6251 **28/29**. `doctor` gained a **`roles`** column, so the
layer-disagreement that caused S66 is now a check rather than a lesson.

**THE S54 COMPLETENESS VALIDATOR FIRED ON REAL DATA FOR THE FIRST TIME**, and correctly. 2441 line 8
produced all sixteen bands as CUMULATIVE thresholds (`under_15000=0.35, under_17000=0.34, ...`)
rather than the source's explicit ranges, and the validator refused it -
`lookup_table_band_overlap`, `lookup_table_missing_bands`, `lookup_table_bounds_mismatch`. Under
first-match semantics "under 17,000" contains "under 15,000", so the refusal is right. **The row has
still never derived, but it now fails for the correct reason.**

**TWO EXPRESSION NORMALIZERS ALREADY EXIST AND DISAGREE.** `workbench/address_verdicts.py:92`
`normalize_expression` speaks `kind`/`operation`/`operands` and **sorts commutative operands**;
`tax_graph/extract/candidate.py:573` `_normalize_candidate_expression` speaks `op`/`args` and does
not sort. Neither knows about the other. This is the S66 registry-versus-validator drift wearing new
clothes, and it is the reason the candidate diff cannot tell a real disagreement from a reordering.
**Whoever takes the diff round converges these rather than adding a third.**

**QUEUE - one line each. NOT SPECCED.**
1. **SCOPE THE DOCUMENT INVENTORY to forms and worksheets** - S74 included instructions booklets,
   so `form_6251_2025` line 13 derived an operand pointing at `instructions_schedule_d_2025`. An
   instructions-document operand must be a named finding. Small real-project round.
2. **S76 LIFT THE INSTRUCTION PARSER into `tax_graph/`** - deferred 2026-08-07, spec recoverable at
   `bcec03d`. Real-project; the invariant test is the deliverable: no instruction section filed under
   a line absent from that form's printed-line inventory. 106 phantoms -> 0, 1040 256 -> 143.
3. **`form_13614_c_2025` yields 0 printed anchors** - a manifest document producing nothing.
4. **Column 3 becomes the agreed notation** - the S69 flow is an edge dump: zero `<svg>`, zero
   diamonds, zero Yes/No arrows across all 157 panels; it renders `zero_floor` and node ids into the
   human column and re-narrates upstream lines. Must implement `docs/review-notation.md` rules 1-8,
   with phrasing read from the operation registry. Was specced at `41fffff`; recover with `git show`.
5. **LIFT the accessor into the project** - make `tax_graph/extract/candidate.py` use it so the
   GENERATED graph stops baking raw OCR into node labels (46 of 232 today), and move the invariant
   test into `tests/`. This is the round that pays the full-suite cost.
6. **Depth-normalized candidate diff** - all **5 of 5** overlapping rows report a false
   `expression_disagreement`, because the candidate expression refers to neighbours by node id while
   `_live_expression` inlines the handcrafted subtree; same rule, two depths. Compare at one depth.
7. **Round-trip renderer** - render a tree back to English from the operation registry and diff it
   against the printed source; disagreement becomes a review finding. Generation is deterministic
   even where parsing is not, so this is the reliability check the pipeline currently has no form of.
8. **Sibling subexpression recovery (CSE)** - 2441 line 25's `UNRESOLVED` block is `MIN(line 20, line
   21)`, sitting in the sibling branch. Hashing subtrees recovers deterministically what a human gets
   by reading across. Same machinery as item 3; do them together or not at all.
9. **Construction drift detection** - reviews call out new punctuation and usage as a ranked finding
   with system-filed evidence, against the versioned inventory S68 produces.
10. **Column and grid recovery**; **phrase obligations**; **S53 approval gate**; **known-red cleanup**.

**STANDING FAILURES, honest.** 2441 line 25 wrong for the **eighth** consecutive run - now
`LOOKUP_TABLE arguments must be named leaf operands with a role`, after one repair. 6251 lines 13 and
20 **no longer fail closed**; both repair to a cross-document reference (`max(form_1040_2025 line 4,
0)` and `max(form_1040_nr_2025 line 15, 0)`). That is a status change, not a win: the references
resolve now, and whether they resolve to the RIGHT line is unreviewed.

## Previous round - M20-S80

**M20-S80 WORKER COMPLETE (2026-08-07). CLICK TO ENLARGE. SMALL ROUND; awaiting Architect acceptance.**

**PILOT RULES BIND.** Everything under `pilot/`; tests in the pilot, out of `tests/`; no full-suite
run; no provider run.

**S79 IS ACCEPTED at `a94a8aa`**, verified by the Architect on the artifact rather than the report:
branch arms diverge (Yes box at x=8, No at x=187, connectors leaving the diamond at different points
and rejoining at line 18), **zero duplicate start+direction pairs**, **zero Yes/No labels inside a
box**, the threshold and offset are their own table nodes rather than inlined into the diamond,
2441 line 20 renders as a two-step chain using `amount`, and line 25's finding carries its real
reason in plain wording with no dict and no `ValueError`.

**THE ASK.** John, 2026-08-07: *"can you let me click on one of these underdisplayed SVGs and see it
in a bigger popout or something?"*

**THE CAUSE IS THE COMPARISON PAGE, NOT THE DIAGRAM.** Five renderings side by side squeeze a
320-unit-wide SVG into roughly a 200px column. **The real review panel has ONE flow column and will
not have this problem** - so fix the comparison page, and do not shrink or re-lay-out the diagram to
suit it.

1. **Click any diagram to open it enlarged** - a lightbox or `<dialog>`, at a size where the text is
   comfortably readable. Click outside or press Escape to close. The 6251 line 18 SVG is 320x676, so
   the enlarged view must **scroll vertically rather than scale down to fit**.
2. **Self-contained.** The page is opened from the filesystem, so **no external scripts, fonts or
   stylesheets** - inline everything. It must work from `file://`.
3. **Apply it to the lookup TABLE renderings too**, not only SVG. 2441 line 8's sixteen bands are
   just as cramped in a fifth of the page.
4. **Keep every S79 guarantee.** Do not change diagram geometry, sizes, or the divergence and label
   checks. Re-report them so a regression is visible.

**Evidence required.** Regenerate the options page and confirm: the enlarged view opens and closes,
nothing loads from the network, and the S79 checks still pass - empty/placeholder cells zero, no
duplicate connector start+direction, no label inside another box, and every SVG's width and height
unchanged.

**Do not choose for John.** This round exists so he can finally see the options at full size and pick
one.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-07).** `pilot/render_options.py` now wraps the generated flow SVG
and lookup-table renderings in keyboard-accessible preview triggers. An inline filesystem-safe
`<dialog>` copies the generated content at its intrinsic size; tall SVGs scroll vertically and
wide lookup tables scroll horizontally. Click the backdrop, the Close button, or press Escape to
close. No external scripts, fonts, stylesheets, or network URLs are emitted. S79 SVG markup and
geometry are unchanged; the enlarged SVG CSS preserves each element's declared width and height.

**TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_render_options.py -q`
-> **10 passed, 1 known `.pytest_cache` permission warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\render_options.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s80_renderings.html`
-> **157/157 produced for all five renderers; zero failures/placeholders; 3 SVGs at 320x416,
320x676, 320x676; connector and edge-label geometry checks checked**. Static artifact inspection
-> **2 preview triggers, dialog open/close/backdrop/Escape handlers present, no external script,
link, or network URL**.

**NOT RUN:** live browser click/open/close verification. The in-app browser security policy
blocked navigation to the generated `file://` page; no alternate browser or policy workaround was
used. The pilot test and static artifact checks cover the emitted handlers, but this browser leg
remains unverified for Architect acceptance.

**How to rebuild a candidate** - the two commands, in order, because the second is worthless
without a run from current code:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe experiments\derive_cells_s25.py --year 2025 --output-dir <RUN> --document form_1040_2025 --document form_2441_2025 --document form_6251_2025
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tax_graph.cli regenerate-candidate --run-dir <RUN> --output-dir <CAND> --expected-document form_1040_2025 --expected-document form_2441_2025 --expected-document form_6251_2025
```

**ONE RED IS OURS, and S64's evidence mislabelled it.**
`tests/test_m20_s31.py::test_all_prompt_templates_render_with_representative_values` fails with
`ValueError: prompt has unsupported placeholder: operation_documentation`. The Worker recorded it as
an "existing prompt fixture omission"; it is not existing. **It PASSES at `origin/main` (26eead7)
and fails on our tree**, because S66 added `<<operation_documentation>>` to `prompts/derive_cells.md`
without adding the token to the test's representative values. The pipeline path itself is fine - the
canary derived 65 rows through that same template - so this is the pinned vocabulary contract test
going red, not a product defect. Fix is the fixture, not the prompt.

**The other 20 are pre-existing**, established by A/B against `origin/main` in a worktree with the
local `.cache`, `graph/2025/_drafts`, and `build/` junctioned in so the comparison is fair: 3 fail
identically on a bare checkout, 5 more fail identically once the artifacts are present, and all 11
`tests/e2e/*_m15` fail identically with an empty review queue (0 documents, the known stale-queue
condition). `tests/test_review_scope_migration_m15.py` is UNCOMPARABLE - it skips at baseline for
missing 2441 extension artifacts and fails on ours, so it is untriaged, not cleared.

**Full suite on our tree: 21 failed, 841 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed.**

**PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT must be a SHORT path.** A run rooted under the Claude session scratchpad
produced **70 failures across 28 files**, every one of them `shutil.Error ... [WinError 3]` from
MAX_PATH overflow while copying `graph/2025/_drafts` into the fixture project. The same tests pass
on `C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\tgpt`. A long temp root does not fail a few tests, it fails
whole files at once - that shape is the signature, not a code regression.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; awaiting Architect acceptance).** M20-S70 is implemented under
`pilot/` as `cell_access.py`, the rewired `review_panel.py` and `constructions/measure.py`, their
tests, and README updates. `CellText.value is None` is typed absence; the label accessor reads
`label_after` only, so an absent caption cannot fall through to candidate or anchor text. The
accessor also owns form-face, instruction, expression, rendered wording, findings, status, and
graph operand reads. No provider was run and no candidate or graph artifact was written.

**REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_review_panel.html`
-> **157 anchors; 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none; 92 holes; captions 8 present / 149 absent;
instruction sections 17 present / 140 absent; operations 65 present / 92 absent**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\constructions\measure.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_constructions.yaml`
-> **construction inventory written**. The panel invariant covers all 157 anchors and no returned
caption begins and ends with the same printed line token.

**TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_cell_access.py -q`
-> **2 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **5 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\constructions\test_measure.py -q`
-> **4 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**. The warning is the known
permission failure writing the pre-existing `.pytest_cache`; the short override avoided the poisoned
`.test_tmp`. No provider run and no full suite were performed, per pilot rules.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; M20-S72 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot now stops graph expansion at nested plain form-line references, renders them as `line X`,
and hashes repeated operation subtrees so later occurrences say `same expression as above`.
Column 3 emits no graph node ids; the `zero_floor` modelling oddity remains reported in the
summary and the graph is unchanged. `build_panel` records per-panel arrow counts and their
distribution. The summary and CLI now call the accessor-resolved count **instruction rows**;
the S71 candidate has 17 such rows (4/8/5 by document) and 16 unique locators. The alleged 84
rows is not present in this candidate's 67 `rows_detail` records, so no second section count is
carried into the panel. Changes are limited to `pilot/` and pilot tests/docs.

**S72 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN against the S71 candidate at the path above. Before the fix,
45 diagram/chain panels had distribution `{4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 2, 11: 2,
12: 1, 13: 1, 14: 1, 16: 3, 17: 1, 18: 2, 19: 1, 20: 1, 23: 2, 24: 1, 26: 2, 27: 1,
28: 2, 33: 1, 35: 1, 47: 1, 48: 1, 53: 1, 55: 1, 107: 1, 109: 1, 111: 1, 233: 1, 251: 1}`
with max 251 and modes 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none. After the fix, distribution is
`{4: 9, 5: 2, 6: 1, 16: 2, 17: 1}`, max 17, with modes 4 diagrams / 11 chains / 142 none.
The residual max 17 is still above the rough dozen target and is reported plainly; further
notation/CSE work remains queued. The 157 generated flow sections contain no node-id leakage.

**S72 TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **7 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_cell_access.py -q`
-> **2 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\constructions\test_measure.py -q`
-> **4 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**. The warnings are the
known permission failure writing the pre-existing `.pytest_cache`; no provider run or full suite
was performed, per pilot rules.

## Current round

**M20-S81 WORKER COMPLETE (2026-08-07). RAISE EXPRESSION DEPTH.** This advances queue item 1:
the production derivation default is now depth 3, and the graph projection consumer uses the same
bound. No operation vocabulary, prompt wording, or promoted artifact was hand-authored.

**REAL PROVIDER CANARY.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe experiments\derive_cells_s25.py --year 2025 --output-dir C:\tmp\m20_s81_run --document form_2441_2025`
-> **form_2441_2025: 20 attempted, 17 derived, 2 repaired, 2 errored, 14 skipped**. Line 25 is
`repaired` with the expected nested `MAX`/`IF_ELSE`/`MIN`/`SUBTRACT` expression; the baseline
held it as a validation error. The two other expression changes were commutative MAX operand
reorders (lines 20 and 26). Line 30 changed COPY(line 2) to SUM(line 2), which matches the form's
verbatim instruction to add the amounts in column (d); this is recorded as a source-justified
provider variation, not silently treated as equivalent.

**DOWNSTREAM PROJECTION.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tax_graph.cli regenerate-candidate --run-dir C:\tmp\m20_s81_run --output-dir C:\tmp\m20_s81_candidate --expected-document form_2441_2025`
-> **candidate written; line 25 is `repaired` with no finding; 41 draft nodes emitted**. Drafts
remain temporary and unpromoted.

**TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_derive_cells_m20.py -q`
-> **66 passed, 1 known `.pytest_cache` permission warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_candidate_regeneration_m20.py tests\test_m20_s54.py tests\test_doctor_m20.py -q`
-> **20 passed, 1 known `.pytest_cache` permission warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_m20_s31.py -q`
-> **8 passed, 1 known `.pytest_cache` permission warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**.

**NOT RUN:** full local suite and Tier 3 shakedown; those remain Architect-side per the standing
rules. No provider prompt or schema wording was changed; the required live provider row did run.

## Open for Architect

**Nothing is open for the Architect.** The three items `doctor` flagged STALE at 73 commits on
2026-08-05 are closed: the **S36 denominator decision** (moot - S51 replaced the denominator
with 121 of 478 anchors and a named reason per skip); the **two scoping calls** (worksheets
closed by the S59 nomination chain; the filing-status constant answered by measurement -
`schedule_1a_2025` line 17 and `form_6251_2025` line 18 both emit correct role-keyed lookups);
and **"what is next"** (John chose option (b), structure and association, on 2026-08-05).

**Open for JOHN, not blocking:** during bootstrap, "every cell receives meaningful human
approval before use" and "a human does not read every new cell" cannot both hold. The pipeline
can eliminate RE-review - approve once against stable semantics, fingerprint the clauses, carry
the verdict while nothing changes - but not first review. That decision shapes S53.

## From Architect

**One spec at a time. The next round is specced when it is picked up.**

## History

Everything before M20-S23, and all per-round Worker narration, lives in git history. This file was
pruned from 7,520 lines on 2026-08-02 at S28 acceptance; `git show 12240ef:plans/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
is the last unpruned copy. Earlier prune: 2026-07-23, from 1,198 lines, for public-repo prep.
Durable rulings were carried forward into **Binding rulings** above rather than deleted; A9
rulings remain pinned in `plans/PHASE_M15.md`; the defect ledger (D6, D9, D10, D12, D13, D14) is
in `AGENTS.md`.
