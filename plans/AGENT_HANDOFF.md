# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

The single living doc for active Claude (Architect) <-> Codex (Worker) coordination. Update it in
place; do NOT spawn new per-topic note files. Standing rules: `../AGENTS.md`. Master plan:
`../docs/engineering-plan.md`. Phase plan: `PHASE_M20.md`.

## How to use
- **Worker:** raise questions/blocks under **Open for Architect**.
- **Architect:** answer there (and pin durable decisions into the relevant `PHASE_<id>.md`), then
  clear the item. Record active direction under **From Architect**.
- **THIS FILE IS LIVE STATE ONLY.** The ball, the round in flight, the open questions, and the
  ONE task spec being worked. Durable rulings and standing constraints live in `../AGENTS.md`
  and are never pruned. History lives in git. **Queued future rounds are ONE LINE each** - a
  full spec written rounds ahead goes stale, which is exactly what happened to S57.
- **Keep it short.** A round that completes gets its narration DELETED, not appended - the
  accepted hash is the record and `git show <hash>` recovers everything. Only the current round,
  the standing constraints, and the binding rulings live here.
- **Prune at every acceptance, not "at phase close".** Pruned 2026-07-23 to 1,198 lines, then
  grew to 7,520 by 2026-08-02 because acceptance never triggered a prune. That is the failure
  mode this section exists to prevent.

## BALL

**BALL: CODEX. M20-S102 is specced below and the whole round is offline and deterministic.**
**Nothing is needed from John except the go, and a veto if he disagrees with the ruling in it.**
The one live leg is the Architect's, and it is per-row `row_bench.py`, not a corpus run.

**S101 ACCEPTED (`acb14bd`, Architect, 2026-08-12). Verified by running the corpus, the live
provider leg, and the full suite - not by reading the report.**
- **FULL SUITE: 17 failed, 953 passed, 8 skipped, 1 xfailed in 1:01:53, on a quiet tree.** The SAME
  17 test ids as the accepted baseline, and **12 more passing than S100's 941.** Confirmed by
  differencing two independent hour-long runs: the only id that left the failure set is the R1
  contract the round moved.
- **THE MANIFEST NOW RECORDS WHAT WE MAINTAIN.** `ownership` is on all 26 non-region entries and
  absent from all 19 regions; regions resolve through their parent booklet. **`gate` was kept
  DISTINCT and both axes are stated once**: `gate` (`project|user`) is the historical fact of who
  stood at the promotion gate; `ownership` is the forward commitment to maintain. **Do not merge
  them.**
- **THE TIER DRIFT IS DEAD, AND A GUARD KEEPS IT DEAD.** `tiers.T1` is 9 and `tiers.T2` is 5,
  matching requirements sections 9.2 and 9.3 id-for-id. John's PLUS set lives in an explicit
  `core_plus_documents` list, `core_documents` is 22, and **`load_core_plus_document_ids` REJECTS an
  id named by both a tier and the core-plus list** - which is the mechanism that stops T1 being
  re-inflated a fourth time. The reconcile is bidirectional and wired into `validate 2025`.
- **FORM 1116, ITS INSTRUCTIONS, AND PUBLICATION 514 ARE ACQUIRED**, hashes pinned from the real
  downloads, all three loading through `load_document_input`. **`acquire --check` reports 26
  unchanged and `changed: -` empty**, so the protected set never moved.
- **6251 LINE 8 NOW EMITS `COPY(form_1116_2025, line 17)`** - the right answer, live. It stops at
  `operand_inventory_unavailable` because 1116's lines are deliberately unmodelled, which is the
  boundary the spec drew.
- **THE REFUSAL GATE IS HONEST: 59 refusals, 59 reported, 0 unreported, 0 core unreported.** The 17
  structural skips became REPORTED, not hidden - the gate reads `structural_skip_reason` now.
- **AN ACQUIRED-BUT-UNMODELLED FORM IS SAYABLE.** Form 1116 is a live document with `status: planned`
  and a stub message; no field map was minted; `validate 2025` exits 0. **The same predicate now
  serves two gates** - the AcroForm check and the R1 address contract both exclude documents not
  claimed as modelled, rather than growing two ad-hoc exception lists.

**BOTH ANTI-EROSION GUARDS WERE DEMANDED AND BOTH EXIST.** A status flag cannot silence either gate:
`test_planned_acroform_is_skipped_but_modelled_inventory_drift_fails` proves the AcroForm check still
fails for a modelled document whose inventory drifts, and `test_r1_still_detects_drift_in_modelled_documents`
proves the R1 contract still fails when a modelled document is added. **Without these two, this round
would have shipped two gates that could be disarmed by editing a YAML field.**

**THE WORKER REFUSING TO EDIT A GUARD TEST WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF THE ROUND.** He stopped, changed
nothing, and asked for an explicit ruling. **That is the rule working, and it caught the Architect** -
the first fix proposed in its place, a positive "count documents carrying address bindings"
predicate, **does not work**: only 15 documents have entries in `graph/2025/bindings/nodes` against a
frozen baseline of 17. **Recorded so it is not retried.**

**NOT DEMONSTRATED, AND IT IS A REPORTING GAP NOT A MECHANISM GAP.** The original floor asked for the
tier guard to be run against the four documents that were drifting on 2026-08-11 and shown catching
them BEFORE the fix. **That was never done** - the drift was resolved by authoring the tier file to
agree, and the guard is proven only against a synthetic fixture and today's reconciled state. The
mechanism is genuinely bidirectional and tested; **what is missing is the evidence that it fires on
the real four.** Do not read this round as having proven that.

**ONE METHOD LESSON, PAID FOR IN AN HOUR OF WALL CLOCK.** An Architect full-suite run reported 31
failures and was INVALID: it was launched against a tree the Worker was actively editing, with
concurrent pytest sessions. Three of its failures passed in isolation. **Never run the full suite
while another agent is working the tree** - the result is not a baseline, it is noise.


## Current round

**M20-S102 SPECCED BY ARCHITECT (2026-08-12). THE GRAPH LEARNS WHAT A PRIOR YEAR IS.**
**REAL-PROJECT ROUND** - full-suite floor applies. This is queue item 1.

**WHY THIS ONE.** It is the newest measured defect, it sits on CORE documents, and unlike item 2 it
has no workaround: today the pipeline cannot even SAY the thing the form says. Item 6 got cheaper
after S101 but is small; item 2 was measured on 2026-08-11 and the A/B said explicitly do not jump
it ahead.

**THE RULING, because the queue item asked for a decision and this is it.**
**A prior-year reference is an EDGE TO THE SAME DOCUMENT IN ANOTHER TAX YEAR, and its VALUE is an
input.** Both halves, because the three options in the queue item are not exclusive:
- **The ADDRESS is a different document.** `simplified_method_worksheet_2024`, `form_1040_2024`,
  `schedule_d_2024` are what the printed text actually names, and the address must survive verbatim
  so a human approval keyed to it stays durable.
- **The VALUE is supplied, not computed.** We do not model 2024's graph and we are not going to.
  The node is an unresolved stub whose value arrives from the filer or from a prior Return Record.
- **It is NOT a bare `REQUIRE_INPUT`,** which erases the address and is the degenerate green this
  round must not buy.

**THE MACHINERY IS ALREADY HALF BUILT, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A SMALL ROUND.** Verified 2026-08-12:
`schemas/document.schema.json` and `schemas/node.schema.json` both already carry
`status: unresolved` plus `stub_message`, and documents already carry `tax_year`. S90c built the
out-of-corpus stub path. At the RUNTIME end the cross-year path exists too: `ingest_prior_record`
and `load_carryforward_block` in `tax_graph/record/return_record.py` prime this year's input facts
from last year's carryforward block, validated by `schemas/carryforward.schema.json`.
**What is missing is only the middle: nothing lets a DERIVED rule name a prior-year address.**

**MEASURED ON THE REAL ARTIFACTS, 2026-08-12, so the round starts from printed text and not from a
guess.** Read out of `.cache/raw/2025/*.txt`.
- **Seven core FORM FACES carry a prior-year reference:** 1040 `26` ("amount applied from 2024
  return"), 2441 `9b` ("If you paid 2024 expenses in 2025, complete Worksheet A") and `13`
  ("carried over from 2024"), Schedule A `13` ("Carryover from prior year"), Schedule D `6` and
  `14` (Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet), Schedule 3 `6b` ("Credit for prior year minimum tax").
- **Twelve NUMBERED WORKSHEET ROWS in two core booklets name an explicit prior-year canonical
  address.** Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet lines 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 name `2024 Form 1040 line 15`
  and `2024 Schedule D` lines 21, 7, 15; 2441 Worksheet A lines 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 12 name
  `2024 Form 2441` lines 3, 6 and `2024 Form 1040 line 11`. **Both worksheets are already promoted
  documents in `graph/2025/documents/`.**
- **Zero `_2024` documents or nodes exist in the graph.** The concept is genuinely absent, not
  half-present.

**A REAL DEFECT FOUND WHILE VERIFYING, AND IT IS THE TELLTALE FOR THIS ROUND.**
`_document_stub` (`tax_graph/extract/candidate.py:1094`) writes `"tax_year": int(year)` from the RUN
year, ignoring the document id's own year, and `_stub_title` strips the year suffix. **So a stub for
`form_1040_2024` would today be written as title "Form 1040" with `tax_year: 2025`** - a second
document with the same title and the wrong year. Related: `_external_form_is_named`
(`cells.py:2649`) strips the year suffix before matching, so **a year-shifted id can already read as
source-backed and mint a silent wrong-year stub.** Fix both; they are the mechanism by which this
would go wrong quietly.

**THE NEGATIVE FIXTURE IS THE POINT OF THE ROUND. READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE.**
The queue reported Simplified Method lines **2 and 6** failing with
`operand_document_not_found: simplified_method_worksheet_2024`. The printed booklet says:
- **Line 6 is a REAL prior-year reference:** *"Enter the amount, if any, recovered tax free in years
  after 1986. If you completed this worksheet last year, enter the amount from line 10 of last
  year's worksheet."* The correct operand is **`simplified_method_worksheet_2024` line 10**.
- **Line 2 is NOT.** Line 2 reads *"Enter your cost in the plan at the annuity starting date."* The
  prior-year note printed just below it belongs to **line 4** ("skip line 3 and enter the amount
  from line 4 of last year's worksheet on line 4 below"), and it was swept into line 2's packet.
**Making prior-year references legal would turn line 2's WRONG answer into a PASSING wrong answer.**
That is the exact shape the 2026-08-11 A/B caught on 6251 `8` and AGENTS.md already warns about.
**Line 2 going green is a regression in this round, not a win.** Line 4's own case is an alternation
("if you completed this worksheet last year ... otherwise go to line 3") and is queue item 10, still
HELD; do not solve it here, but do not let line 4 silently lose its printed DIVIDE rule either.

**THE TARGET STATE.**
1. **A typed, non-fatal `prior_year_reference` validator kind exists** in `cells.py`, distinct from
   both `operand_document_not_found` and `unresolved_external_reference`. It fires when the operand
   document's stem matches a document in this year's inventory and only the year differs.
2. **It is SOURCE-BACKED or it does not fire.** The row evidence must carry a prior-year cue - an
   explicit prior year, "last year", "prior year", "carryover/carried over from". Absent a cue the
   operand stays a hard failure. **`_external_form_is_named` must stop folding the year away**, so
   a year shift is a deliberate finding rather than an accidental match.
3. **Prior-year stubs carry their OWN year.** A minted document stub for `form_1040_2024` has
   `tax_year: 2024`, a title that distinguishes it from the 2025 document, `status: unresolved`, and
   a `stub_message` that names the year and the address. Node ids stay canonical:
   `form_1040_2024_line_15`.
4. **The refusal accounting names them.** A prior-year reference must never be reported as a missing
   document; S101's refusal report partitions it as its own kind, reported and not hidden.
5. **The report says how many there are, per document.** Mechanism in the floor, not a number in the
   code.

**EXPLICITLY DEFERRED, AND SAY SO IN THE ROUND REPORT RATHER THAN DOING IT.**
`return_record.py` hardcodes five capital-loss constants (`CAPITAL_LOSS_SOURCE_NODE`,
`CAPITAL_LOSS_SHORT_TERM_NODE`, `CAPITAL_LOSS_LONG_TERM_NODE`, and the two `_TARGET`s) - hand-
authored answers where the PRIME DIRECTIVE wants derivation, and once prior-year references exist in
the graph those targets are derivable from it. **Do not rewire the Return Record this round.** One
wire-touching change per round; this round's wire is `cells.py` plus `candidate.py`. **What IS in
scope is a REPORT: list the carryforward targets the new prior-year references imply, and state
whether they match the two hardcoded capital-loss targets.** That evidence specs the follow-up.

**THE FLOOR.**
- **Simplified Method line 6 resolves to `simplified_method_worksheet_2024` line 10**, as a
  prior-year reference, `derived`, with ONE provider call and no repair consumed.
- **Simplified Method line 2 does NOT become a prior-year input.** Assert this as a guard test with
  the printed line 2 text as the fixture. **If it goes green, the round has failed, not passed.**
- **A guard test proves an operand naming a year-shifted document with NO prior-year cue in its
  evidence stays a hard `operand_document_not_found`.** The pair of guards must be visible in the
  same file, the way S90b's pair is.
- **A guard test proves a minted prior-year stub carries its own year**, and that no document in the
  candidate graph has an id year that disagrees with its `tax_year`. **Run it against today's
  `_document_stub` and show it FAILING before the fix** - S101's report had to admit the tier guard
  was never demonstrated against the real drift, and that gap is avoidable here.
- **The Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet and 2441 Worksheet A rows listed above resolve to
  prior-year addresses on `form_1040_2024`, `schedule_d_2024`, `form_2441_2024`,** or the report
  names each one that does not and why.
- **The prior-year targets report is produced**, per the deferral clause above.
- **Full suite** against the accepted 17-red / 953-passed baseline at `acb14bd`, **on a quiet tree**.
  Do not launch it while another agent is editing; that lesson cost an hour last round.
- **`tools/check_ascii.py` OK** and `git diff --check` clean.

**WHO RUNS WHAT.**
- **WORKER, offline, all of it.** The predicate, the cue gate, the stub year fix, the refusal
  partition, every guard test, and the targets report are deterministic. No provider, no network.
- **ARCHITECT, live, at acceptance:** `pilot/row_bench.py` on the named rows only - Simplified
  Method `2`, `4`, `6`, Schedule D `6`, `14`, 1040 `26`, Schedule A `13`, 2441 `9b`, `13`.
  **Per-row and cheap. An hour-long corpus run to check nine rows is not acceptable** (John,
  2026-08-10).

**OUT OF SCOPE.**
- **Modelling tax year 2024.** No 2024 graph, no 2024 extraction, no 2024 acquisition.
- **Rewiring the Return Record** - deferred above, deliberately.
- **The line 4 alternation** (item 10, HELD) and **the empty instruction packets** (item 2, parked).
- **The four genuinely missing documents** named in queue item 1 - `schedule_se_2025`,
  `form_6252_2025`, `form_w2_2025`, `form_1099_g_2025`. Those are items 4 and 6, a different family.


## Open for Architect

Nothing. **S101 is accepted at `acb14bd` and the full suite is back to the 17-red baseline at 953
passed.** The Worker's R1 reconciliation was verified, not taken on report.
**M20-S102 is specced above and takes queue item 1.** The ruling it makes - a prior-year reference
is an edge to the same document in another year, whose value is an input - is the Architect's call
on the decision that item explicitly deferred; **John can veto it, and the round waits on nothing
else.** Item 6 stays cheap and small after S101; item 2 stays parked, per its own A/B.


## Queued (ONE LINE each - do not spec ahead)

**JOHN'S PRIORITY, 2026-08-10: get the CORE documents processing reliably.** Ordered for that.
**Every item below is a PIPELINE change - none of them is a per-cell human correction.**

1. **[SPECCED AS M20-S102, 2026-08-12 - see Current round]
   PRIOR-YEAR DOCUMENTS ARE A CATEGORY THE GRAPH HAS NO CONCEPT OF** (Architect, measured
   2026-08-11 on the live derivation of the promoted worksheets). Simplified Method lines 2 and 6
   fail with `operand_document_not_found: simplified_method_worksheet_2024` because the printed row
   says *"enter the amount from line 4 of last year's worksheet"* - **the model read it correctly
   and the graph has nowhere to put it.** This recurs anywhere a worksheet carries a balance
   forward. **It is NOT the out-of-corpus stub case** (item 6): the document exists, it is just a
   different tax year. Decide whether a prior-year reference is an input the filer supplies, a
   distinct document, or an edge to the same document in another year.
   **The same run named four genuinely missing documents:** `schedule_se_2025` and `form_6252_2025`
   are real IRS forms absent from the manifest (the Form 1116 case in item 4); `form_w2_2025` and
   `form_1099_g_2025` are information returns and belong to the stub work.

2. **170 OF 404 PRINTED ANCHORS (42%) DERIVE WITH AN EMPTY INSTRUCTION PACKET** (Architect,
   measured 2026-08-11 on the production path, `for_line` at `cells.py:291`). Per form empty:
   6251 61%, schedule_d 54%, 2441 45%, schedule_a 32%, 1040 29%, schedule_3 23%, schedule_2 16%,
   schedule_1 13% - and **schedule_1a and schedule_b are 100%, all 56 anchors, zero sections**.
   **Not a parser bug: `instruction_sections` creates a slice only under a heading that NAMES a
   form line**, and Schedule B and Schedule 1-A organise their booklets by Part and topic
   (`Part I. Interest`, `No Tax on Tips`), naming no lines. **HTML does not fix it** - the same
   headings appear there, so this is the IRS's organisation, not our rendering. Same defect family
   as S97: keying on a printed cue and silently dropping everything the cue misses.
   **MEASURED 2026-08-11 (Architect, live A/B, 6 rows that are BOTH broken AND empty-packet). THE
   ANSWER IS DISAPPOINTING AND IT SETTLES THE ORDERING: DO NOT JUMP THIS AHEAD.** Arm A is
   production today; arm B injects the booklet text that actually discusses the line.
   **ONE clean win in 6:** `schedule_b_2025` `8` error -> repaired as `require_input`, and that IS
   right - the form face reads "foreign trust? If 'Yes,' you may have to file Form 3520", a filer
   question, not a computation.
   **ONE DEGENERATE PASS, and counting it would be lying:** `form_6251_2025` `8` error -> derived as
   `require_input`. The form face is "Alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit", which comes from
   an AMT Form 1116. Arm A failed HONESTLY with `operand_document_not_found: form_1116_2025`;
   arm B went green by declaring the value filer-supplied and **dropping the cross-form rule**. That
   is the wrong-but-passing shape AGENTS.md already warns about. Its real fix is queue item 4.
   **ONE ARM INVALID:** `schedule_b_2025` `5` arm B died on `missing_instruction_locator` - my
   injected text carried no locator, so that row measured my harness, not the question.
   **THREE FAIL FOR REASONS INSTRUCTIONS CANNOT TOUCH:** `form_6251_2025` `1a` and
   `schedule_1a_2025` `14a` are `incomplete_evidence` on the FORM FACE, identical in both arms;
   `schedule_d_2025` `4` is `operand_document_not_found` for `form_4684_2025`, identical in both
   arms. **The dominant blockers in this sample are form-face completeness and out-of-corpus form
   stubs - already queued as items 3 and 9 - not the missing instructions.**
   **CAVEAT, stated so nobody over-reads it:** n=6, one arm invalidated, one sample per arm and no
   repeat runs. Indicative, not conclusive. **It is enough to keep this behind the worksheet line,
   not enough to close the item** - 170 anchors still derive blind and that remains a real defect.
3. **UNTITLED COMPUTATIONS THAT CARRY WORKSHEET WEIGHT** (Architect, 2026-08-11). The EIC
   `## Step N` blocks compute real quantities - `Step 2 Investment Income` sums 1040 `2a`+`2b`+`3b`
   +`7a` with a floor rule and an $11,950 threshold - but have no title and no local line numbers,
   and `Step 5 Earned Income` contains an **untitled worksheet** whose lines 1-5 interleave with the
   surrounding question numbering. **This is the other half of the 4-row validator-scope cluster**
   (1040 `5a`, `5b`, `27a`, 2441 `10`): unharvested because there is no title to key on.
   **Proposed rule: a printed address decides.** Titled and line-numbered becomes a document;
   untitled becomes an intermediate node owned by the line it feeds. **The false-positive fixture is
   Schedule D `Wash Sales`**, a numbered list 1-4 that is conditions, not arithmetic.
4. **MARK THE CORE SET IN THE MANIFEST, AND ACQUIRE FORM 1116** (John, 2026-08-11).
   **JOHN'S RULING:** core is Tier 1 + Tier 2 of `docs/tax_graph_requirements.md` section 9,
   **PLUS Schedule A, Schedule 1-A, and Form 6251**. **Form 2441 is NOT core** - review-cycle tier.
   **ACQUIRE Form 1116 and its instructions:** documented first-phase in Tier 4, never added to the
   manifest, and it is already causing failures - the 2026-08-11 A/B shows `form_6251_2025` `8`
   dying on `operand_document_not_found: form_1116_2025`. **That is a missing CORE document, not an
   out-of-corpus form; do not stub it.**
   **THE GATE THE MARKING BUYS: core means ZERO UNREPORTED refusals.** Non-core may refuse, but the
   refusal must surface for review (item 5). John, 2026-08-11: *"a few extra is not a problem. I
   just didn't want to become the maintainer of everything."* **So the field should express
   OWNERSHIP, not only priority** - project-maintained, review-cycle, or community-contributed.
   **HEADS-UP, verified 2026-08-11:** `schemas/manifest.schema.json` `$defs.document` sets
   `additionalProperties: false` with 7 keys, so this is a SCHEMA change, not a YAML edit.
   **The tier list and the manifest have already drifted** - Schedule A, Schedule 1-A, 2441, and
   6251 are in the run and in no tier; 1116 and Pub 514 are in a tier and not in the manifest.
   **Fix the drift in the same round or it recurs.**
5. **[MOSTLY DELIVERED BY S100] A REFUSED WORKSHEET REACHING A HUMAN.** `pilot/review_panel.py`
   now reads `worksheet-discovery*.yaml` and separates promoted from refused with their reasons.
   **The RESIDUAL is the third clause only: a clear confirmation when a later run FIXES one.**
   Original entry, kept for its reasoning: (Architect, verified 2026-08-11). The
   harvester builds a `WorksheetFinding` with the reason and **the reason dies on the console**.
   `_copy_worksheet_drafts` only tracks documents ALREADY in the manifest, so a worksheet that was
   never built is not even reported missing - it is absent from the universe. `pilot/review_panel.py`
   has **zero** mentions of worksheets. **This is the alerting John asked for and it does not
   exist.** Needs: refusal reasons carried into the candidate, surfaced in the review UI, and a
   clear confirmation when a later run fixes one.
6. **STUBS FOR OUT-OF-CORPUS FORMS, and fix the `Form(s) X` alias.** 1040 `25c` hard-fails because
   the evidence says "Form(s) W-2G" and the matcher builds `form w2g`. Same "(s)" quirk that spared
   1040 `1a` from the reference guard.
7. **A LEAF MEANING "SUPPLIED HERE".** The only genuinely NEW vocabulary; needs the enum gate.
   Blocks 2441 `5`, where `REQUIRE_INPUT` is legal as a whole rule but not as a lookup branch.
8. **SKIP HUMAN-VERIFIED CELLS ON RERUN** - the step S94 deliberately left out. It must read the
   review ledger, **not a prior run's status**, because re-deriving an approved cell could silently
   replace an approved answer.
9. **Repair calls that return an unchanged payload** must be detected and not spent (2441 `5`).
10. **`CASE` / alternation** - still HELD; revisit with the wide-run evidence.
11. **"Report issue" from a reviewer corrective** (John, 2026-08-10) - optional and **never hidden**;
   emit a ready-to-paste GitHub body, no network and no auth to maintain. **Cluster by failure kind
   and answer shape, not by form**, so 50 reports of one cause collapse into one issue. Derivation
   runs on BLANK forms so the payload carries no filer data; **the reviewer's own comment is the one
   field needing a preview before sending.** Product work - after the core set is reliable.
12. **SHAREABLE FORM PACKAGES + THE FORM DIRECTORY** (John, 2026-08-11). Design PINNED in
    `docs/distribution.md`; **do not redesign it here.** Two build items only: an `install` verb
    that consumes another publisher's package, and a machine-readable index the README page is
    GENERATED from. **Product work - explicitly after the core set is reliable**, since a directory
    advertises a capability that a booklet silently dropping 26 of 28 worksheets cannot back.
13. **TWO S99 REPORTING NITS, neither changes what gets written** (Architect, measured 2026-08-11).
   **(a) An empty oracle result is still labelled `disagree`.** `worksheet_harvest.py:200` treats
   only `None` as `unavailable`, so a title found in the Markdown with zero numbered rows reads as
   a disagreement. **Four 1040 worksheets carry a bogus disagreement** (Qualified Tips, Multiple
   Trades, both Overtime), all with `markdown_lines=[]`. Cosmetic now that findings are advisory,
   but it dilutes a review queue that is meant to be a ranked worklist.
   **(b) Table 183's malformed claim counts as a refusal** even though its worksheet WAS harvested
   from table 182's window, so `refused=4` reads as four missing worksheets when two are the
   out-of-scope EIC blocks and one is this duplicate. **The overlap check should run BEFORE the
   validity check** - t183 was already owned, so it should have been a `window_claim_overlap`.
14. **THE `REFERENCES` EDGES ARE WRITTEN AND READ BY NOTHING** (Architect, verified 2026-08-11,
   carried forward unanswered from the S100 rework). `worksheet_harvest.py` mints them into every
   draft, `promote-worksheet` excludes them from promotion, and **no code in `tax_graph/` consumes
   that relationship** - the only other matches are SQL foreign keys. The exclusion's stated reason
   (that promoting them would make an unruled field look computed) does not hold. **Promote them or
   stop minting them; do not leave a dead relationship being written to disk.**
15. **Housekeeping:** `pilot/context_arms.py` still scores `REQUIRE_INPUT` as a recovered formula;
   run-together instruction headings (`**Line 2dDepletion**`) - **now explained: a PDF-render
   artifact, the HTML separates them cleanly (`28% Rate Gain Worksheet-Line 18`), so S97's division
   of authority may retire this**; artifact-pinned test counts measured
   against untracked `.cache/raw`; `form_8949_2025` needs table-form treatment (4 anchors, 0
   admitted); 2441 `19`/`21`/`25` are a KNOWN-UNSTABLE set - do not read them as signal.
16. **A MISSING CONFIG SECTION REPORTS AS A MISSING API KEY** (Architect, diagnosed 2026-08-12;
   John queued it the same day). The three-tier secret fallback John wanted **already exists** -
   `resolve_secret` (`tax_graph/config.py:167`) tries an explicit `api_key`, then the keyring named
   by `api_key_keyring`, then the env var named by `api_key_env`, then the persisted user
   environment - and `config/tax-graph.config.example.yaml` already documents it identically for
   `llm` and `ocr`. **Nothing is missing from the design.** What failed is the diagnostic: the local
   config had no `ocr:` section at all, so all three lookups returned `None` and the renderer said
   `RendererUnavailable: Mistral OCR requires an API key`. **That one string covers three different
   user mistakes** - no section, a section with no key source, and a key source that resolved empty -
   and it cost two sessions hunting for a key that was set the whole time. **Fix the message to name
   the actual condition, and add a `doctor` check that diffs the live config's sections against the
   example's** - verified 2026-08-12 that `doctor` has no config validation today, so this is the
   general cure rather than a per-section patch.

**REPORT EVERY ROUND WITH `pilot/run_report.py`** - per-document coverage against every printed
anchor, plus a row-level floor check. Validated against four real runs.

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\run_report.py <RUN> --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_rest --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_run
```

**TEST FIXES ONE CELL AT A TIME, NOT WITH A CORPUS RUN.**
`rederive_cell(document_id, line, draft_comment)` is a discrete call - cents and seconds.
`pilot/row_bench.py` replays a recorded row for free. **An hour-long run to check a handful of rows
is not acceptable** (John, 2026-08-10).


## Standing operational notes

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-08; M20-S84 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot review page now has one full-width Tree and Math column. The retired positional renderer,
flow-only summary fields, SVG output, moderator-role constant, arrow glyph, and flow-only CSS/data
are removed from `pilot/review_panel.py`. Tree headers are left aligned, child indentation is
32px, and informative graph roles remain while position-implied roles stay suppressed. Holes
render their stored reason: the real cand_s71 workspace reports 83 `selector_no_formula_cue`, 7
structural, and 2 derivation rows. `--top N` ranks by operation count then operand count and keeps
the full 157-anchor totals in the summary. Default output is `C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`.
The root `.gitignore` now ignores only `.test_tmp/` and ignores the empty root `tmp/` directory.

**S84 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py 'C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71' --output C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`

83 selector_no_formula_cue / 7 structural / 2 derivation; max operands 23**. RAN the same command
with `--top 14` and `--top 25` -> **14 and 25 rendered operation rows respectively**, with the
full 157-anchor summary retained. The generated full page has **zero** `flow-svg`, `flow-edge`,
`MODERATOR_ROLES`, and `<svg` occurrences. Role counts are unchanged from the pre-S84 page, and
the longest Math line is **392 characters before and after**. Form 6251 line 18 renders as a Tree

**How to rebuild a candidate** - the two commands, in order, because the second is worthless

```

**FULL-SUITE BASELINE (Architect, 2026-08-11, at `5e72db3`): 17 failed, 923 passed, 8 skipped,
1 xfailed in 58:22.** Supersedes the 21/841 baseline. **All 17 are environment or artifact reds and
NONE is ours** - the triage, the A/B recipe, and the named test ids are in BALL above. The former
"one red is ours", `test_m20_s31.py::test_all_prompt_templates_render_with_representative_values`,
is **green** (8 passed); the `operation_documentation` fixture no longer diverges from the prompt.
`test_review_scope_migration_m15.py` is **no longer UNCOMPARABLE** - it fails identically in both
arms on a `review_queue/2025/deferred_review.yaml` that exists in neither tree.

**PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT must be a SHORT path.** A run rooted under the Claude session scratchpad
produced **70 failures across 28 files**, every one of them `shutil.Error ... [WinError 3]` from
MAX_PATH overflow while copying `graph/2025/_drafts` into the fixture project. The same tests pass
on `C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\tgpt`. A long temp root does not fail a few tests, it fails
whole files at once - that shape is the signature, not a code regression.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; awaiting Architect acceptance).** M20-S70 is implemented under
`pilot/` as `cell_access.py`, the rewired `review_panel.py` and `constructions/measure.py`, their
tests, and README updates. `CellText.value is None` is typed absence; the label accessor reads
`label_after` only, so an absent caption cannot fall through to candidate or anchor text. The
accessor also owns form-face, instruction, expression, rendered wording, findings, status, and
graph operand reads. No provider was run and no candidate or graph artifact was written.

**REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_review_panel.html`

permission failure writing the pre-existing `.pytest_cache`; the short override avoided the poisoned
`.test_tmp`. No provider run and no full suite were performed, per pilot rules.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; M20-S72 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot now stops graph expansion at nested plain form-line references, renders them as `line X`,
and hashes repeated operation subtrees so later occurrences say `same expression as above`.
Column 3 emits no graph node ids; the `zero_floor` modelling oddity remains reported in the
summary and the graph is unchanged. `build_panel` records per-panel arrow counts and their
distribution. The summary and CLI now call the accessor-resolved count **instruction rows**;
the S71 candidate has 17 such rows (4/8/5 by document) and 16 unique locators. The alleged 84
rows is not present in this candidate's 67 `rows_detail` records, so no second section count is
carried into the panel. Changes are limited to `pilot/` and pilot tests/docs.

**S72 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN against the S71 candidate at the path above. Before the fix,
45 diagram/chain panels had distribution `{4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 2, 11: 2,

with max 251 and modes 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none. After the fix, distribution is
`{4: 9, 5: 2, 6: 1, 16: 2, 17: 1}`, max 17, with modes 4 diagrams / 11 chains / 142 none.
The residual max 17 is still above the rough dozen target and is reported plainly; further
notation/CSE work remains queued. The 157 generated flow sections contain no node-id leakage.

## Open for Architect

**S92 [DONE] WORKER STATUS (2026-08-09), commit `6833dad`:** Implemented `pilot/row_bench.py` and
`pilot/test_row_bench.py`. Replay is read-only and uses the production `_render_cell_prompt`,
`_apply_payload`, and `validate_cell_output`; live mode delegates to production `derive_cells`
while capturing its prompts and responses. No production code, prompt, validator, graph, or
review state changed.

**THE 15-ROW GROUPING IS CONFIRMED WITH ONE CORRECTION.** The embedded-worksheet validator
pattern is 1040 `5a`, `5b`, `27a`, and 2441 `10`; 1040 line `10` is derived and is not in the
15-row error set. The 1040 rows carry 11,424 and 43,748 character instruction packets that
embed Simplified Method and EIC worksheets. 2441 line 10 carries the Credit Limit Worksheet;
its internal line 3 says subtract line 2 from line 1, which the parent-row validator reads as
the row rule. This is the same validator scope defect, with a different worksheet.

The remaining groups match the spec: quote-not-verbatim on 1040 `3b`, `35a`; expression grammar
payload rejection on 1040 `12e`, 2441 `5`; unknown external document on 1040 `25c`, 6251 `8`;
source-side no-call evidence gaps on 2441 `8`, 6251 `1a`; line-format mismatch on 6251 `2h`,
`2`; and self-reference on 1040 `38`. Replay confirms first and repair payloads are rejected
under the same production validator for every provider-reached row.

Two source-backed qualifications are recorded. For 6251 `2`, printed `1z` is present in the
1040 field inventory, address map, and binding, but is absent from the promoted semantic node
inventory used by `build_reference_inventory`; the hard failure is therefore a graph inventory
shape gap, not a missing form control. For 6251 `8`, the acquired 6251 instructions do name
Form 1116, but the row's joined instruction text is empty, so the current payload is not
source-backed in the packet the model received and the hard failure is correct until that join
is fixed.

The 15 replay screens were produced from `C:\tmp\m20_s91b\run`; no provider leg was run. **ANSWERED - THREE DISTINCT FIXES, AND NONE OF THEM IN PRODUCTION YET.** Both of your
qualifications are Architect-verified: the reference inventory holds **42** printed lines for 1040
and `1z` is **not** among them (no node id contains it), and 6251 `2` and `8` both have **zero**
instruction characters. Your correction to my grouping is accepted - the worksheet cluster is 1040
`5a`, `5b`, `27a` and 2441 `10`; **1040 `10` was my error, it derives.**

**1. VALIDATOR SCOPE is the big one (4 rows), but "scope it to the row's own instruction section"
is not the rule** - the worksheet IS inside the row's own section. The rule is: **line-number
references inside an embedded worksheet block are the WORKSHEET's, not the parent row's.** The
blocks are titled ("Simplified Method Worksheet", "Credit Limit Worksheet"), so the boundary is
findable.
**2. INSTRUCTION JOINS** - 6251 `2` and `8` receive an empty packet. Upstream, separate.
**3. PROMOTED-NODE INVENTORY** - `1z` exists as a form line but not as a node the validator will
accept. Same family as the stub work.

**PROVE EACH ONE IN THE HARNESS FIRST. NO PRODUCTION CHANGE UNTIL A FIX IS DEMONSTRATED THERE.**
That is John's standing direction for this effort and replay mode makes it free: **extend
`row_bench.py` to take an experimental validator variant and report which of the 15 rows flip to
accepted.** A fix that cannot move a row in replay does not belong in `tax_graph/`.
model-quality change.

**S91b WORKER STATUS (2026-08-09):** Implemented the provider-free strict-substring extension to
the printed-bracket clause selector. `clean_form_face_text_with_extent` keeps the near-empty-face
rule and now also selects the bracket when the normalized fallback face is a strict substring of
the bracket face. `clause_extent` records `selection_reason` as `weak_fallback`,
`fallback_strict_substring`, or `fallback` alongside both candidate faces and the disagreement
direction. The real 2025 corpus selects **68** rows: the prior **42** weak-face repairs plus **26**
strict-substring repairs. The disagreement split remains **44 bracket-longer / 27 fallback-longer**.

selection. `_bracketed_source_text` uses neighboring indexed printed anchors, accepts a full anchor
or its trailing letter as the start, strips dot-leader-only rows, and ends at the full anchor. The
cell layer keeps the existing geometry cleanup as fallback, selects the bracket only for a weak
projected face when it is not shorter, and records both faces, selection method, and disagreement
direction in `clause_extent` metadata. The real 2025 corpus selected **42** repairs; the measured
disagreement split is **44 bracket-longer / 27 fallback-longer**. The cited good-face cases remain
on fallback where the bracket would over-capture.

the line from the external document while requiring source evidence to name the document.

NOT RUN: full suite; it exceeds the Worker command cap and the graph-validator copy ACL family remains environment-red.

**S90b PREREQUISITE (2026-08-09):** Committed at `ad53a97`; its evidence-backed
out-of-inventory operands now produce the non-fatal `unresolved_external_reference` warning,
retain the structured `unresolved_external_nodes` record, remain `derived` without consuming a
repair, and are copied into candidate-row findings for the review surface. Unsourced unknown
documents remain hard `operand_document_not_found` failures. W-2, every 1099 suffix, and K-1 face
references are excluded from the REQUIRE_INPUT guard as filer-supplied information returns.

**ANSWERED - THAT GUARD IS SUPERSEDED. Rewrite it; the implementation is right.** You were right
to stop. `test_named_unseen_form_reference_mints_unresolved_external_node` is an **S74** guard, not
an S90 one, and its fixture is the exact case S90b redefines: the face reads "Attach Form 4684 and
enter the amount from line 18 of that form", so the reference is evidence-backed and Form 4684 is
simply outside the corpus. **Failing that row closed is the behaviour that cost 27 rows.**

**Replacement assertions.** Status `derived`, not `error`. **Exactly ONE provider call** - the
repair must not be consumed. `unresolved_external_reference` present in
`validator_warnings_by_kind`, `operand_document_not_found` ABSENT, `gapped == 0`. **Keep the
`unresolved_external_nodes` payload assertion byte-for-byte** - that record is what S74 actually
bought and S90b does not change it.

**Add the complementary guard in the same file, so the pair is visible:** an operand naming a
document the row's own evidence does NOT name stays a hard `operand_document_not_found` with
status `error`. That is the line `_legitimate_external_reference` draws, and reusing that existing
predicate rather than inventing a second one was the right call.

**The information-return rule is verified on real rows.** Architect ran it against the S89 corpus:
flagged rows drop **12 -> 11**, `form_6251_2025` line 2j is correctly no longer flagged, and
synthetic faces "from Form W-2, box 1", "from Form(s) W-2", "from Form 1099-R, box 1", "from Form
1099-DIV" and the K-1 face all read as inputs while "from Form 8863, line 8" still flags. **By
family, not by spelling, as specced.**

**The live leg was not run by the Worker.** S90b acceptance still rested on it: coverage back to at least
139 of 157, `form_6251_2025` line 13 back to `max(qdcgt line 4, 0)`, and the 64 plus 13 intact.

NOT RUN: live provider leg; requires the network-capable acceptance context.

**S90b acceptance remains a network-capable Architect check:** verify that the 12 S89 input rows
are repaired into cross-document operands or named unresolved-reference findings, with no silent
`REQUIRE_INPUT` result. S90c adds the candidate-graph stub and lifecycle gate above.

**S89 is accepted; its items are cleared. The record is `d2a077f` and the BALL block.**

**S85 Part C is open for the Architect:** the fresh three-document run used the pinned
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna` model but all 34 attempted rows failed with
`LlmUnavailable: OpenRouter request failed: Connection error.` The regenerated candidate is
empty of rules, so Form 6251 line 18 execution and the real-data comparator/checkbox proof remain
unverified. Rerun Part C in a network-capable context; no authorization escalation is needed. The
Worker also could not create or write under `C:\tmp` in this sandbox, so the mandated panel path
needs verification there. S86 remains after the full-suite result.

**S86 worker verification is open for Architect:** the impacted worker slice is 139 passed with 9
environment failures, all `WinError 5` while `test_examples_m8.py` and
`test_nversion_m8.py` copy ACL-protected `graph/2025/_drafts/` directories. The model accessor,
attribution, doctor, extraction, re-derivation, batch, prompt experiment, extension, workbench, and
offline example slices passed. Run the full suite against the known 20 baseline and verify the
provider leg in a network-capable context; the Worker did not run either under the 600-second cap.

The three items `doctor` flagged STALE at 73 commits on
2026-08-05 are closed: the **S36 denominator decision** (moot - S51 replaced the denominator
with 121 of 478 anchors and a named reason per skip); the **two scoping calls** (worksheets
closed by the S59 nomination chain; the filing-status constant answered by measurement -
`schedule_1a_2025` line 17 and `form_6251_2025` line 18 both emit correct role-keyed lookups);
and **"what is next"** (John chose option (b), structure and association, on 2026-08-05).

**Open for JOHN, not blocking:** during bootstrap, "every cell receives meaningful human
approval before use" and "a human does not read every new cell" cannot both hold. The pipeline
can eliminate RE-review - approve once against stable semantics, fingerprint the clauses, carry
the verdict while nothing changes - but not first review. That decision shapes S53.

## History

Everything before M20-S23, and all per-round Worker narration, lives in git history. This file was
pruned from 7,520 lines on 2026-08-02 at S28 acceptance; `git show 12240ef:plans/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
is the last unpruned copy. Earlier prune: 2026-07-23, from 1,198 lines, for public-repo prep.
Durable rulings were carried forward into **Binding rulings** above rather than deleted; A9
rulings remain pinned in `plans/PHASE_M15.md`; the defect ledger (D6, D9, D10, D12, D13, D14) is
in `AGENTS.md`.
