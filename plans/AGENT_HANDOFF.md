# AGENT_HANDOFF.md

The single living doc for active Claude (Architect) <-> Codex (Worker) coordination. Update it in
place; do NOT spawn new per-topic note files. Standing rules: `../AGENTS.md`. Master plan:
`../docs/engineering-plan.md`. Phase plan: `PHASE_M20.md`.

## How to use
- **Worker:** raise questions/blocks under **Open for Architect**.
- **Architect:** answer there (and pin durable decisions into the relevant `PHASE_<id>.md`), then
  clear the item. Record active direction under **From Architect**.
- **THIS FILE IS LIVE STATE ONLY.** The ball, the round in flight, the open questions, and the
  ONE task spec being worked. Durable rulings and standing constraints live in `../AGENTS.md`
  and are never pruned. History lives in git. **Queued future rounds are ONE LINE each** - a
  full spec written rounds ahead goes stale, which is exactly what happened to S57.
- **Keep it short.** A round that completes gets its narration DELETED, not appended - the
  accepted hash is the record and `git show <hash>` recovers everything. Only the current round,
  the standing constraints, and the binding rulings live here.
- **Prune at every acceptance, not "at phase close".** Pruned 2026-07-23 to 1,198 lines, then
  grew to 7,520 by 2026-08-02 because acceptance never triggered a prune. That is the failure
  mode this section exists to prevent.

## BALL

**BALL: CODEX. M20-S121 is specced below - model-owned instruction segmentation, cell-naive, as a
pilot.**

**JOHN RULED THE FORK, 2026-08-17: THE MATCHER GOES MODEL-OWNED, AND THE MODEL MUST BE NAIVE ABOUT
THE CELLS.** He raised the objection that decides the design: *"I'm afraid to give a model too much
if it is to pick out the instructions. We have the example of line 24 referencing line 22 and the
instructions for line 22 get jammed in."* **Asking a model for one cell's instruction is a question
with a demand in it. Asking it to describe a document's sections is not.** So the model segments the
booklet, never sees a cell, and code does the join. **This is also the boundary John set on
2026-08-02** - the form face is exact, the instruction pages are loose, the AI reconciles.

**THE DETERMINISTIC MATCHER LINE IS CLOSED. Five rounds, S116 through S120, and every one found the
previous one's blind spot** - cross-form `Line 9`, multi-line headings, nested duplicates, worksheet
row numbers read as form lines. **Those are all semantics a person reads instantly and a heading
parser cannot. Do not spec another one.** The topic-organised booklets settle it: `schedule_1a`'s 48
cells and `schedule_b`'s 8 have no line token to match and **no deterministic matcher can ever
reach them.**

**M20-S120 IS ACCEPTED (`e2294b8`, Architect, 2026-08-17), VERIFIED BY RECOMPUTATION.** I re-tiled
every one of S119's **56** parent spans from the artifact myself: the **414** split rows are
contiguous, non-overlapping, hit the parent endpoints exactly and sum to the parent length, in every
booklet - **zero conservation failures**. All **81** cells are classified with **0 omitted and 0
extras** against S119's negatives, and the EIC table and front matter are marked non-actionable.
**9 passed.** The round did exactly what it was asked; **what it was asked was partly wrong, and
that is recorded under Current round.**

**M20-S119 IS ACCEPTED (`0d7aa76` + `77e56c8` + `8c70a70`, Architect, 2026-08-17), VERIFIED BY
RECOMPUTATION.** All 8 booklets reconcile against recomputed hashes and file sizes; every named
floor case holds. **Its finding stands and is the durable one: extent truncation is 10 of 91 cells,
all `form_1116`.**

**M20-S118 IS ACCEPTED (`3181169` + `a4cd008`), M20-S117 (`954c235`), M20-S116 (`6beb1f4` +
`29cbbcd`), M20-S114 (`9f856a9`), M20-S113 (`6b855b4`)** - all verified by recomputation, narration
in git. **What survives of them:**
- **Nested duplicates in evidence packets are gone** (17 -> 0) and `AMBIGUOUS` is 4, not 60.
- **The reconciliation report asks `instruction_span_ids_for_line` and nothing re-implements the
  match.** Report state equals packet state, asserted over every cell.
- **THE RULE COUNT IS NOT A QUALITY METRIC. NEVER USE IT AS A FLOOR AGAIN.**
- **A green replay harness is not evidence about a packet change** - check whether its cases even
  cover the changed cells first. On S118 the two sets were disjoint.
- **Verify an artifact by recomputing what it asserts**, not by checking it exists and is green.
  Three rounds in a row, that is what found the defect.

**CORPUS, ALL 17 DOCUMENTS, 2026-08-17: rules 74, edges 181, gaps 154**, 41 minutes. **Not
comparable to the S113 record of 78/224/153** - different counting method, four rounds between.
**Blast-radius check was clean: 17 of 19 changed cells derive**, `form_1040` 6b now derives, and the
two that do not are an outline-index defect and `schedule_1` line 1.

**M20-S115 IS DELIVERED AND WAS NEVER ACCEPTED (`4f7abf9`, Codex, 2026-08-16). ARCHITECT MISS,
CAUGHT WHILE REVIEWING THE PUSH RANGE 2026-08-17.** The review contract - `workbench/server.py`,
`generated_review.py`, the new `review_defects.py`, `test_m20_s115.py` and the workbench front end -
went in and the Architect specced S116 the next morning without verifying it. **It is on `main` and
now on the remote, unverified.** It touches the surface John reviews, so it needs a live check, not
a test read: **that is the Architect's leg and it is owed before the review contract is trusted** - and John does
not review while the contract keeps moving, so an unverified contract change is worse than none.

**THE RULE COUNT IS NOT A QUALITY METRIC. NEVER USE IT AS A FLOOR AGAIN.** `rules >= 107` was
unsatisfiable by construction: the round's purpose was to stop treating non-computations as
computations. **That was the sixth floor written that the work could not satisfy.** Rulings are
pinned in `../docs/derivation-architecture.md`.

**THREE JOHN RULINGS, 2026-08-16, NOW QUEUED AS WORK:**
1. **`filer_entry` needs a reason taxonomy** - `derivation_failed` (a defect) vs
   `source_form_not_modelled` (a scope fact). `form_1040` 1f is the second: Form 8839 is not
   acquired. **Fold into S115 if cheap; otherwise its own round.**
2. **`form_1040` 6b's decline is a PACKET DEFECT.** It declined for want of the Social Security
   Benefits Worksheet, **which the graph contains**. *"We model the worksheets so that they can
   support the forms."* When a line's evidence names a worksheet the graph has, that worksheet
   belongs in the packet.
3. **ROUTING IS ITS OWN CONSTRUCT.** `schedule_d` 17 is flow control, not an election. Until routing
   exists, **`election` must be validated so it stops absorbing branches** - the same failure mode
   as `COPY` absorbing line 36.

**ARCHITECT NOTE.** John: *"do what you think best. I don't understand why this is such a big deal
for you."* **Acceptance is the Architect's call and was being escalated unnecessarily.** Bring John
decisions only where the answer changes what gets built.

**DIRECTION IS PINNED IN `../docs/derivation-architecture.md`. READ IT FIRST.** Sequencing: harness
(DONE, `80980e7`) -> model owns the path (DONE, `6b855b4`) -> **review surface (THIS ROUND)** ->
voting.

**M20-S112 IS ACCEPTED (`80980e7`, Architect, 2026-08-16), VERIFIED BY RUNNING.**
`pilot/replay_harness.py` -> **21 cases, 0 mismatches, 5 seconds, network_calls=0**, over the
production validator, resolver and assembler. Corpus untouched at **rules 108, edges 369, gaps 33**.
Codex proved the negative against `9b9333f`; the Architect additionally ran it against `c47f5fa`
(S109) -> **20 of 21 mismatches, exit 1**.

**KNOW THE HARNESS'S LIMIT.** It replays OLD responses and **cannot predict what a CHANGED PROMPT
will make the live model emit** - on the S109 tree it reports `production prompt differs from
recorded prompt` on 19 of 20 cases. **That tripwire is the point: the fixtures are stale, go run the
corpus. A GREEN HARNESS IS NEVER PERMISSION TO SKIP THE CORPUS RE-DERIVE**, and S113 changes the
prompt, which is exactly the case it cannot predict.

**ARCHITECT SPEC DEFECTS TO STOP REPEATING.** S112's floor said "NO model call" and also "run
`extract --year 2025`". Codex correctly took the conservative reading and said so - the fifth floor
written that the work could not satisfy as specified. **Corpus verification and bare test runs are
the Architect's leg and never belong in a Worker floor.**

**M20-S108 (`c2dc0d8` ...), S107 (delivered, not accepted), S106 (`d8accca`), S105 (`98d81dc` +
`82962eb`) - narration pruned 2026-08-17, all in git. **What survives: the corpus varies +/-2 rules and
+/-5 edges run to run, so a single-run delta smaller than that is not evidence; and `prompt-bench`
accepts rows the corpus then rejects, so never quote its verdict as the corpus verdict.**

**THE 18-RED BASELINE, unchanged and still current.** Eleven `tests/e2e/*_m15.py`, plus:
`test_address_campaign_m15r::test_form_8949_cross_form_claims_resolve_exactly`,
`test_field_identity_m16::test_schedule_2_raw_cache_reproduces_target_fields`,
`test_m20_s71::test_real_candidate_node_labels_use_clean_text`,
`test_review_preflight_m15::test_real_2025_preflight_passes_with_all_coverage_dimensions`,
`test_review_scope_migration_m15::test_live_queue_migration_gives_every_pending_entry_a_primary_target`,
`test_schedule_2_m16::test_schedule_2_part_i_raw_acroform_identity`,
`test_schedule_d_extraction_m9::test_schedule_d_fixture_drafts_include_schema_valid_band_tables`.

## Current round

**M20-S121 SPECCED BY ARCHITECT (2026-08-17). MODEL-OWNED INSTRUCTION SEGMENTATION, CELL-NAIVE, AS A
PILOT.** **PILOT ROUND** - `pilot/` only, its own tests, **NO CLI wiring, NO production stage
replaced, NO packet or prompt-template change in `tax_graph/`.** John's rule from 2026-08-06:
exploratory work lives off to the side and gets lifted in once it wins.

**JOHN'S DECISION, 2026-08-17, AND IT IS THE DESIGN.** *"I'm afraid to give a model too much if it is
to pick out the instructions. We have the example of line 24 referencing line 22 and the
instructions for line 22 get jammed in. Maybe we use AI to break up the instructions into sections
and then into lines? If it is naive about the cells, perhaps we can shortcircuit the problem of this
digging deeper when we don't want it."*

**THE PRINCIPLE, AND EVERY ITEM BELOW SERVES IT: THE MODEL NEVER LEARNS THAT A CELL NEEDS AN
ANSWER.** *"What is the instruction for line 24?"* carries a demand, and the nearest plausible answer
is the line 22 text that line 24 points at - **that is the wrong-owner defect this project already
drove to zero once.** *"Read this booklet and describe its sections"* carries no demand. **The model
is never shown the cell inventory, the outline, or the unmatched list.** A section that owns nothing
owns nothing, and absence is an ordinary output rather than a failure to avoid.

**WHY THIS IS CHEAP: THE SEAM ALREADY EXISTS.** `instruction_sections` is already this artifact -
sections with `document_id`, `line_tokens`, and byte locators - merely built by a deterministic
heading parser. **The pilot emits the SAME frame shape.** The span projection
(`_spans_for_instruction_frame`) and the join (`instruction_span_ids_for_line`) are untouched, which
is what makes this one stage rather than a redesign, **and what makes the A/B honest.**

---

### Item 1 - THE SEGMENTER, IN `pilot/`

One pass per booklet. Input: the acquired text and nothing else. Output: the frame shape already in
use - per section a byte range, heading, level, `document_id`, and what it governs.

**THE 1040 BOOKLET IS 683,265 BYTES AND WILL NOT FIT IN ONE CALL. WINDOWING IS PART OF THE ROUND,
NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT.** Window it, overlap the windows, and reconcile sections that straddle a seam.
**Byte conservation is what proves the seams are right** - see the floor.

**`governs` IS TIED TO THE SECTION'S OWN HEADING AND SCOPE, NEVER TO A MENTION IN ITS BODY.** This is
the failure that has now appeared three times - S116's cross-form `Line 9`, S120's worksheet row
numbers read as form lines, and the line 24 / line 22 case John names. **Say so in the prompt, and
make the scorer measure it.**

**A SECTION MAY GOVERN WITHOUT A LINE NUMBER.** *"Part I. Interest"* governs Schedule B's interest
lines and prints no line anywhere. **This is the whole reason the deterministic matcher can never
finish the job** - `schedule_1a` 48 cells and `schedule_b` 8. The frame must be able to express it.

### Item 2 - THE DETERMINISTIC VERIFIER, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL

**The model chooses; the machine proves.** For every section the model emits:
- **its byte range binds to real text in the acquired file**, and the recorded heading matches what
  is actually at that offset;
- **nothing is invented** - no section text that is not a substring of the source;
- **the sections tile the booklet** under the same byte-conservation rule S119 and S120 already
  enforce: claimed once, unclaimed, or overlapping, summing to file size.

**Reuse `pilot/instruction_extent_census.py` for this rather than writing a third implementation.**

### Item 3 - THE A/B AGAINST THE PARSER, SCORED ON THE CENSUS WE ALREADY BUILT

Run both segmenters over the same booklets and score both the same way:
- **cells that gain a correctly-owned instruction**, judged against
  `m20_s116_instruction_reconciliation.yaml`;
- **cells that gain a WRONG owner** - **this is the number that decides the round**, and the line 24
  / line 22 shape is what it is looking for;
- **`schedule_b`'s 8 and `schedule_1a`'s 48**, which the parser provably cannot reach.

---

**WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN.**
- **Do not show the model any cell, outline, address, or unmatched list.** If the segmenter's input
  contains anything derived from the forms, the round is void. **This is the round's whole thesis.**
- **Do not replace, wire, or call the production segmenter.** `tax_graph/extract/` is read-only here
  except as an import.
- **Do not tune the prompt against the answer.** Score, report, stop. **A prompt edited until the
  census score improves is a prompt fitted to 481 cells and it will not generalise.**
- **Do not floor this round on how many cells get attached.** **THE RULE COUNT LESSON APPLIES: a
  count is not a quality metric and has already been an unsatisfiable floor six times.**

**THE FLOOR - OUTCOMES AND INVARIANTS, NOT COUNTS.**
- **The segmenter runs from a RECORDED response fixture with no network**, so every test and the
  whole floor is satisfiable in your sandbox. **The live run is the ARCHITECT's leg** - I have egress
  and will run it. **A floor that needs a model call is mis-specced; say so instead of guessing.**
- **The verifier rejects a fabricated section.** Prove it: feed a section whose range does not match
  its text and show the verifier failing. **A verifier that has never failed is not evidence.**
- **Byte conservation holds on the model's frame** exactly as it does on the parser's, asserted per
  booklet, including across window seams.
- **The A/B scorer runs on both segmenters from fixtures and reports both directions** - gained and
  wrongly-owned - **per booklet, never as one total.**
- **The prompt is checked in and readable**, and the round reports what it says about `governs`.
- **`tools/check_ascii.py` OK**, `git diff --check` clean. Targeted tests only; pre-create your
  `PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT` directory.

**THE ARCHITECT'S LEG, STATED SO IT IS NOT DUPLICATED.** I run the live segmentation on **two
booklets first - `instructions_schedule_b_2025` (13,573 bytes, topic-organised, 8 cells the parser
cannot reach) and `instructions_schedule_d_2025` (line-organised control)** - and report the A/B.
**Blast radius, not the corpus.** The 1040 booklet and its windowing come after those two land.

**OUT OF SCOPE.** Lifting the pilot into the pipeline - **that is the round after this one, and only
if it wins.** `form_1116`'s 10 truncations. Routing. The `filer_entry` taxonomy. The 4 ambiguities.

## Open for Architect

*(Nothing open.)*


## Queued (ONE LINE each - do not spec ahead)

**JOHN'S PRIORITY, 2026-08-10: get the CORE documents processing reliably.** Ordered for that.
**Every item below is a PIPELINE change - none of them is a per-cell human correction.**

**DIRECTION PINNED 2026-08-13 IN `../docs/source-extents.md`. DO NOT REDESIGN IT HERE.** A citation
should record WHERE its text is, not carry a copy of it, and a source chunk that is not a numbered
row should say what it is and what it governs. **The queue has NOT been reshaped around it yet -
that is John's call.** What the doc settles is that items 2, 3, 6 and the recurring extent defects
are one root cause and should stop being specced as separate cue-matching repairs.
**M20-S103 is the first round off that direction and it MEASURES rather than wires**; the storage
round is specced from its output.

**ITEM 1 IS DELIVERED.** Prior-year documents were M20-S102, accepted at `ee6eb55`. The graph now
has the concept, the gate is correct on the real rows, and `status: unresolved` prior-year stubs
carry their own year. **The four documents item 1 also named remain open** and belong to items 4
and 6: `schedule_se_2025` and `form_6252_2025` are real IRS forms absent from the manifest;
`form_w2_2025` and `form_1099_g_2025` are information returns, which
`../docs/source-extents.md` records as NOT covered by the extents work.

1. **[SPECCED AS M20-S102, 2026-08-12 - see Current round]
   PRIOR-YEAR DOCUMENTS ARE A CATEGORY THE GRAPH HAS NO CONCEPT OF** (Architect, measured
   2026-08-11 on the live derivation of the promoted worksheets). Simplified Method lines 2 and 6
   fail with `operand_document_not_found: simplified_method_worksheet_2024` because the printed row
   says *"enter the amount from line 4 of last year's worksheet"* - **the model read it correctly
   and the graph has nowhere to put it.** This recurs anywhere a worksheet carries a balance
   forward. **It is NOT the out-of-corpus stub case** (item 6): the document exists, it is just a
   different tax year. Decide whether a prior-year reference is an input the filer supplies, a
   distinct document, or an edge to the same document in another year.
   **The same run named four genuinely missing documents:** `schedule_se_2025` and `form_6252_2025`
   are real IRS forms absent from the manifest (the Form 1116 case in item 4); `form_w2_2025` and
   `form_1099_g_2025` are information returns and belong to the stub work.

2. **170 OF 404 PRINTED ANCHORS (42%) DERIVE WITH AN EMPTY INSTRUCTION PACKET** (Architect,
   measured 2026-08-11 on the production path, `for_line` at `cells.py:291`). Per form empty:
   6251 61%, schedule_d 54%, 2441 45%, schedule_a 32%, 1040 29%, schedule_3 23%, schedule_2 16%,
   schedule_1 13% - and **schedule_1a and schedule_b are 100%, all 56 anchors, zero sections**.
   **Not a parser bug: `instruction_sections` creates a slice only under a heading that NAMES a
   form line**, and Schedule B and Schedule 1-A organise their booklets by Part and topic
   (`Part I. Interest`, `No Tax on Tips`), naming no lines. **HTML does not fix it** - the same
   headings appear there, so this is the IRS's organisation, not our rendering. Same defect family
   as S97: keying on a printed cue and silently dropping everything the cue misses.
   **MEASURED 2026-08-11 (Architect, live A/B, 6 rows that are BOTH broken AND empty-packet). THE
   ANSWER IS DISAPPOINTING AND IT SETTLES THE ORDERING: DO NOT JUMP THIS AHEAD.** Arm A is
   production today; arm B injects the booklet text that actually discusses the line.
   **ONE clean win in 6:** `schedule_b_2025` `8` error -> repaired as `require_input`, and that IS
   right - the form face reads "foreign trust? If 'Yes,' you may have to file Form 3520", a filer
   question, not a computation.
   **ONE DEGENERATE PASS, and counting it would be lying:** `form_6251_2025` `8` error -> derived as
   `require_input`. The form face is "Alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit", which comes from
   an AMT Form 1116. Arm A failed HONESTLY with `operand_document_not_found: form_1116_2025`;
   arm B went green by declaring the value filer-supplied and **dropping the cross-form rule**. That
   is the wrong-but-passing shape AGENTS.md already warns about. Its real fix is queue item 4.
   **ONE ARM INVALID:** `schedule_b_2025` `5` arm B died on `missing_instruction_locator` - my
   injected text carried no locator, so that row measured my harness, not the question.
   **THREE FAIL FOR REASONS INSTRUCTIONS CANNOT TOUCH:** `form_6251_2025` `1a` and
   `schedule_1a_2025` `14a` are `incomplete_evidence` on the FORM FACE, identical in both arms;
   `schedule_d_2025` `4` is `operand_document_not_found` for `form_4684_2025`, identical in both
   arms. **The dominant blockers in this sample are form-face completeness and out-of-corpus form
   stubs - already queued as items 3 and 9 - not the missing instructions.**
   **CAVEAT, stated so nobody over-reads it:** n=6, one arm invalidated, one sample per arm and no
   repeat runs. Indicative, not conclusive. **It is enough to keep this behind the worksheet line,
   not enough to close the item** - 170 anchors still derive blind and that remains a real defect.
3. **UNTITLED COMPUTATIONS THAT CARRY WORKSHEET WEIGHT** (Architect, 2026-08-11). The EIC
   `## Step N` blocks compute real quantities - `Step 2 Investment Income` sums 1040 `2a`+`2b`+`3b`
   +`7a` with a floor rule and an $11,950 threshold - but have no title and no local line numbers,
   and `Step 5 Earned Income` contains an **untitled worksheet** whose lines 1-5 interleave with the
   surrounding question numbering. **This is the other half of the 4-row validator-scope cluster**
   (1040 `5a`, `5b`, `27a`, 2441 `10`): unharvested because there is no title to key on.
   **Proposed rule: a printed address decides.** Titled and line-numbered becomes a document;
   untitled becomes an intermediate node owned by the line it feeds. **The false-positive fixture is
   Schedule D `Wash Sales`**, a numbered list 1-4 that is conditions, not arithmetic.
4. **MARK THE CORE SET IN THE MANIFEST, AND ACQUIRE FORM 1116** (John, 2026-08-11).
   **JOHN'S RULING:** core is Tier 1 + Tier 2 of `docs/tax_graph_requirements.md` section 9,
   **PLUS Schedule A, Schedule 1-A, and Form 6251**. **Form 2441 is NOT core** - review-cycle tier.
   **ACQUIRE Form 1116 and its instructions:** documented first-phase in Tier 4, never added to the
   manifest, and it is already causing failures - the 2026-08-11 A/B shows `form_6251_2025` `8`
   dying on `operand_document_not_found: form_1116_2025`. **That is a missing CORE document, not an
   out-of-corpus form; do not stub it.**
   **THE GATE THE MARKING BUYS: core means ZERO UNREPORTED refusals.** Non-core may refuse, but the
   refusal must surface for review (item 5). John, 2026-08-11: *"a few extra is not a problem. I
   just didn't want to become the maintainer of everything."* **So the field should express
   OWNERSHIP, not only priority** - project-maintained, review-cycle, or community-contributed.
   **HEADS-UP, verified 2026-08-11:** `schemas/manifest.schema.json` `$defs.document` sets
   `additionalProperties: false` with 7 keys, so this is a SCHEMA change, not a YAML edit.
   **The tier list and the manifest have already drifted** - Schedule A, Schedule 1-A, 2441, and
   6251 are in the run and in no tier; 1116 and Pub 514 are in a tier and not in the manifest.
   **Fix the drift in the same round or it recurs.**
5. **[MOSTLY DELIVERED BY S100] A REFUSED WORKSHEET REACHING A HUMAN.** `pilot/review_panel.py`
   now reads `worksheet-discovery*.yaml` and separates promoted from refused with their reasons.
   **The RESIDUAL is the third clause only: a clear confirmation when a later run FIXES one.**
   Original entry, kept for its reasoning: (Architect, verified 2026-08-11). The
   harvester builds a `WorksheetFinding` with the reason and **the reason dies on the console**.
   `_copy_worksheet_drafts` only tracks documents ALREADY in the manifest, so a worksheet that was
   never built is not even reported missing - it is absent from the universe. `pilot/review_panel.py`
   has **zero** mentions of worksheets. **This is the alerting John asked for and it does not
   exist.** Needs: refusal reasons carried into the candidate, surfaced in the review UI, and a
   clear confirmation when a later run fixes one.
6. **STUBS FOR OUT-OF-CORPUS FORMS, and fix the `Form(s) X` alias.** 1040 `25c` hard-fails because
   the evidence says "Form(s) W-2G" and the matcher builds `form w2g`. Same "(s)" quirk that spared
   1040 `1a` from the reference guard.
7. **A LEAF MEANING "SUPPLIED HERE".** The only genuinely NEW vocabulary; needs the enum gate.
   Blocks 2441 `5`, where `REQUIRE_INPUT` is legal as a whole rule but not as a lookup branch.
8. **SKIP HUMAN-VERIFIED CELLS ON RERUN** - the step S94 deliberately left out. It must read the
   review ledger, **not a prior run's status**, because re-deriving an approved cell could silently
   replace an approved answer.
9. **Repair calls that return an unchanged payload** must be detected and not spent (2441 `5`).
10. **`CASE` / alternation** - still HELD; revisit with the wide-run evidence.
11. **"Report issue" from a reviewer corrective** (John, 2026-08-10) - optional and **never hidden**;
   emit a ready-to-paste GitHub body, no network and no auth to maintain. **Cluster by failure kind
   and answer shape, not by form**, so 50 reports of one cause collapse into one issue. Derivation
   runs on BLANK forms so the payload carries no filer data; **the reviewer's own comment is the one
   field needing a preview before sending.** Product work - after the core set is reliable.
12. **SHAREABLE FORM PACKAGES + THE FORM DIRECTORY** (John, 2026-08-11). Design PINNED in
    `docs/distribution.md`; **do not redesign it here.** Two build items only: an `install` verb
    that consumes another publisher's package, and a machine-readable index the README page is
    GENERATED from. **Product work - explicitly after the core set is reliable**, since a directory
    advertises a capability that a booklet silently dropping 26 of 28 worksheets cannot back.
13. **TWO S99 REPORTING NITS, neither changes what gets written** (Architect, measured 2026-08-11).
   **(a) An empty oracle result is still labelled `disagree`.** `worksheet_harvest.py:200` treats
   only `None` as `unavailable`, so a title found in the Markdown with zero numbered rows reads as
   a disagreement. **Four 1040 worksheets carry a bogus disagreement** (Qualified Tips, Multiple
   Trades, both Overtime), all with `markdown_lines=[]`. Cosmetic now that findings are advisory,
   but it dilutes a review queue that is meant to be a ranked worklist.
   **(b) Table 183's malformed claim counts as a refusal** even though its worksheet WAS harvested
   from table 182's window, so `refused=4` reads as four missing worksheets when two are the
   out-of-scope EIC blocks and one is this duplicate. **The overlap check should run BEFORE the
   validity check** - t183 was already owned, so it should have been a `window_claim_overlap`.
14. **THE `REFERENCES` EDGES ARE WRITTEN AND READ BY NOTHING** (Architect, verified 2026-08-11,
   carried forward unanswered from the S100 rework). `worksheet_harvest.py` mints them into every
   draft, `promote-worksheet` excludes them from promotion, and **no code in `tax_graph/` consumes
   that relationship** - the only other matches are SQL foreign keys. The exclusion's stated reason
   (that promoting them would make an unruled field look computed) does not hold. **Promote them or
   stop minting them; do not leave a dead relationship being written to disk.**
15. **Housekeeping:** `pilot/context_arms.py` still scores `REQUIRE_INPUT` as a recovered formula;
   run-together instruction headings (`**Line 2dDepletion**`) - **now explained: a PDF-render
   artifact, the HTML separates them cleanly (`28% Rate Gain Worksheet-Line 18`), so S97's division
   of authority may retire this**; artifact-pinned test counts measured
   against untracked `.cache/raw`; `form_8949_2025` needs table-form treatment (4 anchors, 0
   admitted); 2441 `19`/`21`/`25` are a KNOWN-UNSTABLE set - do not read them as signal.
16. **A MISSING CONFIG SECTION REPORTS AS A MISSING API KEY** (Architect, diagnosed 2026-08-12;
   John queued it the same day). The three-tier secret fallback John wanted **already exists** -
   `resolve_secret` (`tax_graph/config.py:167`) tries an explicit `api_key`, then the keyring named
   by `api_key_keyring`, then the env var named by `api_key_env`, then the persisted user
   environment - and `config/tax-graph.config.example.yaml` already documents it identically for
   `llm` and `ocr`. **Nothing is missing from the design.** What failed is the diagnostic: the local
   config had no `ocr:` section at all, so all three lookups returned `None` and the renderer said
   `RendererUnavailable: Mistral OCR requires an API key`. **That one string covers three different
   user mistakes** - no section, a section with no key source, and a key source that resolved empty -
   and it cost two sessions hunting for a key that was set the whole time. **Fix the message to name
   the actual condition, and add a `doctor` check that diffs the live config's sections against the
   example's** - verified 2026-08-12 that `doctor` has no config validation today, so this is the
   general cure rather than a per-section patch.

**REPORT EVERY ROUND WITH `pilot/run_report.py`** - per-document coverage against every printed
anchor, plus a row-level floor check. Validated against four real runs.

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\run_report.py <RUN> --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_rest --baseline C:\tmp\m20_s81_run
```

**TEST FIXES ONE CELL AT A TIME, NOT WITH A CORPUS RUN.**
`rederive_cell(document_id, line, draft_comment)` is a discrete call - cents and seconds.
`pilot/row_bench.py` replays a recorded row for free. **An hour-long run to check a handful of rows
is not acceptable** (John, 2026-08-10).


## Standing operational notes

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-08; M20-S84 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot review page now has one full-width Tree and Math column. The retired positional renderer,
flow-only summary fields, SVG output, moderator-role constant, arrow glyph, and flow-only CSS/data
are removed from `pilot/review_panel.py`. Tree headers are left aligned, child indentation is
32px, and informative graph roles remain while position-implied roles stay suppressed. Holes
render their stored reason: the real cand_s71 workspace reports 83 `selector_no_formula_cue`, 7
structural, and 2 derivation rows. `--top N` ranks by operation count then operand count and keeps
the full 157-anchor totals in the summary. Default output is `C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`.
The root `.gitignore` now ignores only `.test_tmp/` and ignores the empty root `tmp/` directory.

**S84 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py 'C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71' --output C:\tmp\m20_s84\review_panel.html`
-> **157 anchors; 65 operation rows; operation counts 1: 51, 2: 12, 6: 2; 92 holes; hole reasons
83 selector_no_formula_cue / 7 structural / 2 derivation; max operands 23**. RAN the same command
with `--top 14` and `--top 25` -> **14 and 25 rendered operation rows respectively**, with the
full 157-anchor summary retained. The generated full page has **zero** `flow-svg`, `flow-edge`,
`MODERATOR_ROLES`, and `<svg` occurrences. Role counts are unchanged from the pre-S84 page, and
the longest Math line is **392 characters before and after**. Form 6251 line 18 renders as a Tree
with `threshold`, `key`, and `filing status` present.

**S84 TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; $env:M20_S73_CANDIDATE='C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\C--Users-devbox-projects-tax-graph\6e1d97d0-c72d-4855-a055-e0c64f6224f8\scratchpad\cand_s71'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **13 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:

-> **34 passed, 1 warning**. RAN `.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py`
-> **ASCII check OK**. The warning is the known permission failure writing the pre-existing
`.pytest_cache`; no provider run and no full suite were performed, per pilot rules.

**How to rebuild a candidate** - the two commands, in order, because the second is worthless
without a run from current code:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe experiments\derive_cells_s25.py --year 2025 --output-dir <RUN> --document form_1040_2025 --document form_2441_2025 --document form_6251_2025
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tax_graph.cli regenerate-candidate --run-dir <RUN> --output-dir <CAND> --expected-document form_1040_2025 --expected-document form_2441_2025 --expected-document form_6251_2025
```

**FULL-SUITE BASELINE (Architect, 2026-08-11, at `5e72db3`): 17 failed, 923 passed, 8 skipped,
1 xfailed in 58:22.** Supersedes the 21/841 baseline. **All 17 are environment or artifact reds and
NONE is ours** - the triage, the A/B recipe, and the named test ids are in BALL above. The former
"one red is ours", `test_m20_s31.py::test_all_prompt_templates_render_with_representative_values`,
is **green** (8 passed); the `operation_documentation` fixture no longer diverges from the prompt.
`test_review_scope_migration_m15.py` is **no longer UNCOMPARABLE** - it fails identically in both
arms on a `review_queue/2025/deferred_review.yaml` that exists in neither tree.

**PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT must be a SHORT path.** A run rooted under the Claude session scratchpad
produced **70 failures across 28 files**, every one of them `shutil.Error ... [WinError 3]` from
MAX_PATH overflow while copying `graph/2025/_drafts` into the fixture project. The same tests pass
on `C:\Users\devbox\AppData\Local\Temp\tgpt`. A long temp root does not fail a few tests, it fails
whole files at once - that shape is the signature, not a code regression.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; awaiting Architect acceptance).** M20-S70 is implemented under
`pilot/` as `cell_access.py`, the rewired `review_panel.py` and `constructions/measure.py`, their
tests, and README updates. `CellText.value is None` is typed absence; the label accessor reads
`label_after` only, so an absent caption cannot fall through to candidate or anchor text. The
accessor also owns form-face, instruction, expression, rendered wording, findings, status, and
graph operand reads. No provider was run and no candidate or graph artifact was written.

**REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\review_panel.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_review_panel.html`
-> **157 anchors; 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none; 92 holes; captions 8 present / 149 absent;
instruction sections 17 present / 140 absent; operations 65 present / 92 absent**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe pilot\constructions\measure.py C:\tmp\m20_s68_candidate --output .test_tmp2\m20_s70_constructions.yaml`
-> **construction inventory written**. The panel invariant covers all 157 anchors and no returned
caption begins and ends with the same printed line token.

**TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_cell_access.py -q`
-> **2 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **5 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\constructions\test_measure.py -q`
-> **4 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**. The warning is the known
permission failure writing the pre-existing `.pytest_cache`; the short override avoided the poisoned
`.test_tmp`. No provider run and no full suite were performed, per pilot rules.

**WORKER COMPLETION (2026-08-06; M20-S72 implementation, awaiting Architect acceptance).** The
pilot now stops graph expansion at nested plain form-line references, renders them as `line X`,
and hashes repeated operation subtrees so later occurrences say `same expression as above`.
Column 3 emits no graph node ids; the `zero_floor` modelling oddity remains reported in the
summary and the graph is unchanged. `build_panel` records per-panel arrow counts and their
distribution. The summary and CLI now call the accessor-resolved count **instruction rows**;
the S71 candidate has 17 such rows (4/8/5 by document) and 16 unique locators. The alleged 84
rows is not present in this candidate's 67 `rows_detail` records, so no second section count is
carried into the panel. Changes are limited to `pilot/` and pilot tests/docs.

**S72 REAL-CORPUS EVIDENCE.** RAN against the S71 candidate at the path above. Before the fix,
45 diagram/chain panels had distribution `{4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 2, 11: 2,
12: 1, 13: 1, 14: 1, 16: 3, 17: 1, 18: 2, 19: 1, 20: 1, 23: 2, 24: 1, 26: 2, 27: 1,
28: 2, 33: 1, 35: 1, 47: 1, 48: 1, 53: 1, 55: 1, 107: 1, 109: 1, 111: 1, 233: 1, 251: 1}`
with max 251 and modes 9 diagrams / 36 chains / 112 none. After the fix, distribution is
`{4: 9, 5: 2, 6: 1, 16: 2, 17: 1}`, max 17, with modes 4 diagrams / 11 chains / 142 none.
The residual max 17 is still above the rough dozen target and is reported plainly; further
notation/CSE work remains queued. The 157 generated flow sections contain no node-id leakage.

**S72 TEST EVIDENCE.** RAN:
`$env:PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT='C:\Users\devbox\projects\tax_graph\.test_tmp2'; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest pilot\test_review_panel.py -q`
-> **7 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:

-> **4 passed, 1 warning**. RAN:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_ascii.py` -> **ASCII check OK**. The warnings are the
known permission failure writing the pre-existing `.pytest_cache`; no provider run or full suite
was performed, per pilot rules.

## From Architect

**NO NEW WORKER IMPLEMENTATION SLICE IS SPECCED AFTER M20-S108 ITEM 1.** The next action is
Architect-owned live re-derivation against the corrected schema, followed by the reported corpus
numbers and constant-case ids. The Worker has completed the offline correction and guard evidence
above; do not start a new provenance or citation round.

**HISTORICAL S107 NOTE - SUPERSEDED.** M20-S107 closed the
last A9 scaffolding seam in the core citations: re-extract 30 hand-authored paraphrases from their
acquired source, and give the 4 synthesized tax-bracket citations a provenance kind that admits they
are computed.

**THE FAILURE MODE TO AVOID IS SPECIFIC AND IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE.** S107 changes
`quoted_text` on purpose, which is the exact operation that got the S106 rework rejected. **The
difference is direction: the rejected pass truncated real quotes to fit wrong ranges; S107 replaces
hand-authored text with what the document actually says.** The guard must keep the SOURCE pinned and
assert the changed set is exactly the named 30. **A diff count other than 30 is a stop, not a
judgment call.**

**AND A NOTE TO MYSELF.** Two of my last three specs set a floor the data could not meet - `7ba64be`
(the drop-to-zero target) and S106 (every core citation binds). Both times the Worker hit the target
honestly and the spec was wrong. **Before writing the next floor, check that the corpus can satisfy
it**; the 34-citation characterization that produced S107 took twenty minutes and would have
prevented S106's red guard entirely.

## History

Everything before M20-S23, and all per-round Worker narration, lives in git history. This file was
pruned from 7,520 lines on 2026-08-02 at S28 acceptance; `git show 12240ef:plans/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
is the last unpruned copy. Earlier prune: 2026-07-23, from 1,198 lines, for public-repo prep.
Durable rulings were carried forward into **Binding rulings** above rather than deleted; A9
rulings remain pinned in `plans/PHASE_M15.md`; the defect ledger (D6, D9, D10, D12, D13, D14) is
in `AGENTS.md`.
